# Building MLflow evaluation datasets

To systematically test and improve a GenAI application, you use an evaluation dataset. An evaluation dataset is a selected set of example inputs — either labeled (with known expected outputs, i.e. ground-truth expectations) or unlabeled (without ground-truth). Evaluation datasets help you improve your app's performance in the following ways:

- Improve quality by testing fixes against known problematic examples from production.
- Prevent regressions. Create a "golden set" of examples that must always work correctly.
- Compare app versions. Test different prompts, models, or app logic against the same data.
- Target specific features. Build specialized datasets for safety, domain knowledge, or edge cases.
- Validate the app across different environments as part of LLMOps.

You can think of them as test suites for your LLM functionality.

## Requirements

:::warning[SQL Backend Required]
Evaluation Datasets require an MLflow Tracking Server with a **[SQL backend](/self-hosting/architecture/backend-store/#types-of-backend-stores)** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or MSSQL).
This feature is **not available** in FileStore (local file system-based tracking). If you need
a simple local configuration for MLflow, use the sqlite option when starting MLflow.
:::

- An evaluation dataset is attached to an MLflow experiment. If you do not already have an experiment, see [Create an MLflow Experiment](/genai/tracing/quickstart/) to create one.

## Data sources for evaluation datasets

You can use any of the following to create an evaluation dataset:

- Existing traces. If you have already captured traces from a GenAI application, you can use them to create an evaluation dataset based on real-world scenarios.
- An existing dataset, or directly entered examples. This option is useful for quick prototyping or for targeted testing of specific features.

This page describes how to create an MLflow evaluation dataset. You can also use other types of datasets, such as Pandas DataFrames or a list of dictionaries. See [Evaluation examples](/genai/eval-monitor/running-evaluation/eval-examples) for more examples.

## Create a dataset using the UI

Follow these steps to use the UI to create a dataset from existing traces.

1. Click **Experiments** in the sidebar to display the Experiments page.
1. In the table, click on the name of your experiment to open it.
1. In the left sidebar, click **Traces**.

   <ImageBox src="/images/genai/traces-tab.png" alt="Traces tab in sidebar" />

1. Use the checkboxes to the left of the trace list to select traces to export to your dataset. To select all traces, click the box next to **Trace ID**.

   <video src={useBaseUrl("/images/genai/select-traces.mp4")} controls loop autoPlay muted aria-label="Selecting traces for eval dataset" />

1. Click **Actions**. From the drop-down menu, select **Add to evaluation dataset**.
1. The **Add traces to evaluation dataset** dialog appears.

   If evaluation datasets exist for this experiment, they appear in the dialog.
   1. Click **Export** next to the dataset you want to add these traces to.
   1. After the traces have been exported, the button changes to **Exported**. Click **Done**.

   If no evaluation dataset exists for the experiment:
   1. Click **Create new dataset**.
   1. In the **Create Dataset** dialog, click **Select schema**, and select the schema to hold the dataset.
   1. Click **Confirm**.
   1. In the **Table name** field of the **Create evaluation dataset** dialog, enter a name for the evaluation dataset and click **Create Dataset**.
   1. The **Add traces to evaluation dataset** dialog appears, showing the dataset you just created. Click **Export** next to the dataset.
   1. After the traces have been exported, the button changes to **Exported**. Click **Done**.

## Create a dataset using the SDK

Follow these steps to use the SDK to create a dataset.

### Step 1. Create the dataset

```python
from mlflow.genai.datasets import create_dataset, set_dataset_tags

# Create your evaluation dataset
dataset = create_dataset(
    name="production_validation_set",
    experiment_id=["0"],  # "0" is the default experiment
    tags={"team": "ml-platform", "stage": "validation"},
)

# Optionally, add additional tags to your dataset.
# Tags can be used to search for datasets with search_datasets API
set_dataset_tags(
    dataset_id=dataset.dataset_id,
    tags={"environment": "dev", "validation_version": "1.3"},
)
```

### Step 2: Add records to your dataset

This section describes several options for adding records to the evaluation dataset.

<TabsWrapper>
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="from-existing-traces" label="From existing traces" default>

One of the most effective ways to build a relevant evaluation dataset is by curating examples directly from your application's historical interactions captured by MLflow Tracing. You can create datasets from traces using either the MLflow Monitoring UI or the SDK.

Programmatically search for traces and then add them to the dataset using `search_traces()`. Use filters to identify traces by success, failure, use in production, or other properties. See [Search traces](/genai/tracing/search-traces#search-traces-overview). You can also add ground-truth expectations to your traces before or after adding them to an evaluation dataset using `log_expectation()`.

```python
import mlflow

# 2. Search for traces
traces = mlflow.search_traces(
    filter_string="attributes.name = 'chat_completion' AND tags.environment = 'production'",
    order_by=["attributes.timestamp_ms DESC"],
    max_results=10,
)

print(f"Found {len(traces)} successful traces")

# 3. Add expectations to the traces
for trace in traces:
    mlflow.log_expectation(
        trace_id=trace.info.trace_id,
        name="expected_answer",
        value=("Expected correct answer for this input"),
    )

# 4. Add the traces to the evaluation dataset
eval_dataset = eval_dataset.merge_records(traces)
print(f"Added {len(traces)} records to evaluation dataset")

# Preview the dataset
df = eval_dataset.to_df()
print(f"\nDataset preview:")
print(f"Total records: {len(df)}")
print("\nSample record:")
sample = df.iloc[0]
print(f"Inputs: {sample['inputs']}")
```

#### Select traces for evaluation datasets

Before adding traces to your dataset, identify which traces represent important test cases for your evaluation needs. You can use both quantitative and qualitative analysis to select representative traces.

**Quantitative trace selection**

Use the MLflow UI or SDK to filter and analyze traces based on measurable characteristics:

- **In the MLflow UI**: Filter by tags (e.g., `tag.quality_score < 0.7`), search for specific inputs/outputs, sort by latency or token usage
- **Programmatically**: Query traces to perform advanced analysis

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Search for traces with potential quality issues
traces_df = mlflow.search_traces(
    filter_string="tag.quality_score < 0.7",
    max_results=100,
    extract_fields=[
        "span.end_time",
        "span.inputs.messages",
        "span.outputs.choices",
        "span.attributes.usage.total_tokens",
    ],
)

# Analyze patterns
# For example, check if quality issues correlate with token usage
correlation = traces_df["span.attributes.usage.total_tokens"].corr(
    traces_df["tag.quality_score"]
)
print(f"Correlation between token usage and quality: {correlation}")
```

For complete trace query syntax and examples, see [Search Query Syntax](/genai/tracing/search-traces#search-query-syntax).

**Qualitative trace selection**

Review individual traces to identify patterns requiring human judgment:

- Examine inputs that led to low-quality outputs
- Look for patterns in how your application handled edge cases
- Identify missing context or faulty reasoning
- Compare high-quality vs. low-quality traces to understand differentiating factors

Once you've identified representative traces, add them to your dataset using the search and merge methods described above.
