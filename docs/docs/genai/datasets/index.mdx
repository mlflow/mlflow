# Evaluation Datasets

## Transform Your GenAI Testing with Structured Evaluation Data

Evaluation datasets are the foundation of systematic GenAI application testing. They provide a centralized way to manage test data, ground truth expectations, and evaluation results—enabling you to measure and improve the quality of your AI applications with confidence.

# Create your first evaluation dataset
dataset = create_evaluation_dataset(
    name="customer_support_qa",
    experiment_ids=["0", "1"],  # MLflow experiment IDs
    tags={"team": "support", "version": "v1.0"}
