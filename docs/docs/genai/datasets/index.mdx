# Evaluation Datasets

## Transform Your GenAI Testing with Structured Evaluation Data

Evaluation datasets are the foundation of systematic GenAI application testing. They provide a centralized way to manage test data, ground truth expectations, and evaluation results—enabling you to measure and improve the quality of your AI applications with confidence.

## Quickstart: Build Your First Evaluation Dataset

There are several ways to create evaluation datasets, each suited to different stages of your GenAI development process. **Expectations are the cornerstone of effective evaluation**—they define the ground truth against which your AI's outputs are measured, enabling systematic quality assessment across iterations.

## The Evaluation Loop

Evaluation datasets bridge the critical gap between trace generation and evaluation execution in the GenAI development lifecycle. As you test your application and capture traces with expectations, **evaluation datasets transform these individual test cases into a materialized, reusable evaluation suite**. This creates a consistent and evolving collection of evaluation records that grows with your application—each iteration adds new test cases while preserving the historical test coverage. Rather than losing valuable test scenarios after each development cycle, you build a comprehensive evaluation asset that can immediately assess the quality of changes and improvements to your implementation.
