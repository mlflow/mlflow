# Evaluation Datasets

## Transform Your GenAI Testing with Structured Evaluation Data

Evaluation datasets are the foundation of systematic GenAI application testing. They provide a centralized way to manage test data, ground truth expectations, and evaluation results—enabling you to measure and improve the quality of your AI applications with confidence.

:::warning[SQL Backend Required]
Evaluation Datasets require an MLflow Tracking Server with a **[SQL backend](/self-hosting/architecture/backend-store/#types-of-backend-stores)** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or MSSQL).
This feature is **not available** in FileStore (local file system-based tracking). If you need
a simple local configuration for MLflow, use the sqlite option when starting MLflow.
:::

## Quickstart: Build Your First Evaluation Dataset

There are several ways to create evaluation datasets, each suited to different stages of your GenAI development process.

The simplest way to create one is through MLflow's UI. Navigate to an Experiment that you want the evaluation dataset to be associated with and you can directly create a new one by supplying a unique name.
After adding records to it, you can view the dataset's entries in the UI.

<ImageBox src="/images/eval-datasets.gif" alt="Evaluation Datasets Video" />

At its core, evaluation datasets are comprised of **inputs** and **expectations**. **Outputs** are an optional addition that can be added to an evaluation dataset for
post-hoc evaluation with scorers. Adding these elements can be done either directly from traces, dictionaries, or via a Pandas DataFrame.

## Understanding Source Types

Every record in an evaluation dataset has a **source type** that tracks its provenance. This enables you to analyze model performance by data origin and understand which types of test data are most valuable.

    icon: Activity,
    title: "TRACE",

  },
  {
    icon: FileText,
    title: "DOCUMENT",
    description: "Test cases extracted from documentation or specs - must be explicitly specified with source metadata"
  }
]} />

Source types are automatically inferred based on record characteristics but can be explicitly overridden when needed. See the [SDK Guide](/genai/datasets/sdk-guide#source-type-inference) for detailed inference rules and examples.

## The Evaluation Loop

Evaluation datasets bridge the critical gap between trace generation and evaluation execution in the GenAI development lifecycle. As you test your application and capture traces with expectations, **evaluation datasets transform these individual test cases into a materialized, reusable evaluation suite**. This creates a consistent and evolving collection of evaluation records that grows with your application—each iteration adds new test cases while preserving the historical test coverage. Rather than losing valuable test scenarios after each development cycle, you build a comprehensive evaluation asset that can immediately assess the quality of changes and improvements to your implementation.
