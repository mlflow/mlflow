# Trace Concepts

## What is Tracing?

Tracing is an observability technique that captures the complete execution flow of a request through your application. Unlike traditional logging that captures discrete events, tracing creates a detailed map of how data flows through your system, recording every operation, transformation, and decision point.

In the context of GenAI applications, tracing becomes essential because these systems involve complex, multi-step workflows that are difficult to debug and optimize without complete visibility into their execution.

## Core Structure

At a high level, an MLflow **Trace** is composed of two primary objects:

**<APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">TraceInfo</APILink>**: Metadata that aids in explaining the origination of the trace, the status of the trace, information about the total execution time, etc. This includes tags that provide additional context for the trace, such as the user, session, and developer-provided key:value pairs. Tags can be used for searching or filtering traces.

**<APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceData">TraceData</APILink>**: The actual payload, which contains the instrumented <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">Span</APILink> objects that capture your application's step-by-step execution from input to output.

</div>

MLflow Traces are designed to be compatible with **OpenTelemetry** specifications, a widely adopted industry standard for observability. This ensures interoperability and allows MLflow Traces to be exported and used with other OpenTelemetry-compatible systems. MLflow enhances the basic OpenTelemetry Span model by defining specific structures and attributes for Generative AI use cases, providing richer context and deeper insight into quality and performance.

### TraceInfo: Metadata and Context

The <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">TraceInfo</APILink> within MLflow's tracing feature aims to provide a lightweight snapshot of critical data about the overall trace. In Python SDK, <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">TraceInfo</APILink> is designed as a dataclass object that contains metadata about the trace.

This metadata includes information about the trace's origin, status, and various other data that aids in retrieving and filtering traces when used with <APILink fn="mlflow.search_traces" /> and for navigation of traces within the MLflow UI.

### TraceData: Container of Spans

The MLflow <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceData">TraceData</APILink> object, accessible via `trace.data`, is a container of <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">Span</APILink> object. This is where the actual execution details are stored, including the request and response data, latency of each step, input and output messages to LLMs, retrieved documents from vector stores, tool call parameters, etc.

Spans in a trace forms a hierarchy through parent-child connections. Each span details a specific unit of work.

For example, the following picture illustrates a set of spans that are organized in a tree structure in a trace. Each line represents a span, where the tree-structure is formed by the curly edges between lines. For example, the root span is "agent", which links to three children spans: 2 LLm calls and 1 tool handling.

To learn more about the span object and its schema, continue to the [Span Concepts](/genai/tracing/concepts/span) page.

## Storage Layout

`TraceInfo` is a lightweight metadata object, hence can be stored directly in a relational database. For example, if you are running MLflow Tracking Server on SQL database such as PostgreSQL, `TraceInfo` is stored as a single row in the trace table and support efficient query with indexes. For example, the data that is contained in the `TraceInfo` object is used to populate the trace view page within the MLflow tracking UI.

`TraceData` (Spans) are relatively large objects compared to `TraceInfo`, because it contains rich information about each execution step, such as the full message history input to an LLM call. Therefore, MLflow stores them in artifact storage rather than in the database. This allows you to handle large number of traces with cheaper costs and minimum impact to the performance of typical filtering and grouping operations for traces.
