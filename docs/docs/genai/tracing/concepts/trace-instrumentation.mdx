# Tracing Concepts

This guide introduces the core concepts of tracing and observability for GenAI applications. If you're new to tracing, this conceptual overview will help you understand the fundamental building blocks before diving into implementation.


## What is Tracing?

**Tracing** is an observability technique that captures the complete execution flow of a request through your application. Unlike traditional logging that captures discrete events, tracing creates a detailed map of how data flows through your system, recording every operation, transformation, and decision point.

In the context of GenAI applications, tracing becomes essential because these systems involve complex, multi-step workflows that are difficult to debug and optimize without complete visibility into their execution.

## Core Architecture: Trace = TraceInfo + TraceData

MLflow traces follow a simple but powerful structure: **`Trace = TraceInfo + TraceData`** where **`TraceData = List[Span]`**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="trace-overview" label="Complete Trace Structure" default>
    A <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Trace">Trace</APILink> in MLflow consists of two main components:

    **<APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">TraceInfo</APILink>**: Metadata about the overall trace (timing, status, preview data)

    **<APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceData">TraceData</APILink>**: The core execution data containing all the individual spans

    This separation allows for efficient querying and filtering of traces while maintaining detailed execution information.

    ![Trace Architecture](/images/llms/tracing/schema/trace_architecture.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="trace-info" label="TraceInfo: The Metadata">
    **TraceInfo** provides a lightweight snapshot of critical data about the overall trace, including:

    **Identification**: Unique trace ID and storage location

    **Timing**: Start time and total execution duration

    **Status**: Success, failure, or in-progress state

    **Previews**: Summary of request and response data

    **Organization**: Tags and metadata for searching and filtering

    ![Trace Info Architecture](/images/llms/tracing/schema/trace_info_architecture.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="trace-data" label="TraceData: The Execution Details">
    **TraceData** contains the core execution information as a list of <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">Span</APILink> objects. These spans are organized in a hierarchical relationship that shows the complete flow of operations in your application.

    Each span represents a single operation and includes detailed information about inputs, outputs, timing, and any errors that occurred.

    ![Trace Data Architecture](/images/llms/tracing/schema/trace_data_architecture.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="span-structure" label="Span: Individual Operations">
    **Spans** are the fundamental building blocks that represent individual operations. Each span complies with the [OpenTelemetry Span specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces#spans) and includes:

    **Identity**: Unique span ID and parent relationships

    **Timing**: Precise start and end timestamps

    **Data**: Inputs, outputs, and operational metadata

    **Context**: Attributes and events for debugging

    ![Span Architecture](/images/llms/tracing/schema/span_architecture.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Key Concepts

### Trace
A **trace** represents the complete journey of a single request through your application. It's a collection of related operations (spans) that together tell the story of how your system processed a user's input to generate an output.

**Example**: A user asks "What's the weather in Paris?" - the trace captures everything from parsing the question to returning the final weather report.

### Span
A **span** represents a single, discrete operation within a trace. Each span has a clear beginning and end, and captures the inputs, outputs, timing, and metadata for that specific operation.

**Key span properties**:
- **Name**: Human-readable identifier (e.g., "Document Retrieval", "LLM Call")
- **Duration**: How long the operation took (measured in nanoseconds for precision)
- **Status**: Success, failure, or error with detailed information
- **Inputs**: Data that went into the operation (JSON-serialized)
- **Outputs**: Results produced by the operation (JSON-serialized)
- **Attributes**: Additional metadata (model parameters, user ID, configuration values)
- **Events**: Significant moments during execution (errors, warnings, checkpoints)

### Parent-Child Relationships
Spans form hierarchical relationships that mirror your application's call structure:

- **Root span**: The top-level operation representing the entire request
- **Child spans**: Operations called by parent operations
- **Sibling spans**: Operations at the same level of the hierarchy

The **parent_id** property establishes these hierarchical associations, creating a clear order-of-operations linkage.

## Span Types

MLflow categorizes spans by their purpose to make traces easier to understand and analyze. Each span type has semantic meaning and may have specialized schemas for enhanced functionality:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="llm-types" label="LLM & Chat" default>
    **SpanType.LLM**: Calls to language models

    **SpanType.CHAT_MODEL**: Interactions with chat completion APIs

    Examples: OpenAI chat completion, Anthropic Claude call, local model inference

    Typically captures: model name, parameters, prompt, response, token usage

    *Special attributes*: `mlflow.chat.messages` and `mlflow.chat.tools` for rich UI display
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="retrieval-types" label="Retrieval & Data">
    **SpanType.RETRIEVER**: Operations that fetch relevant information

    Examples: Vector database search, web search, document lookup

    Typically captures: query, retrieved documents, similarity scores, result count

    *Special schema*: Output must be `List[Document]` for enhanced UI features

    **SpanType.EMBEDDING**: Vector embedding generation

    **SpanType.PARSER**: Data parsing and transformation operations
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="workflow-types" label="Workflow & Logic">
    **SpanType.CHAIN**: Multi-step workflows or pipelines

    Examples: RAG pipeline, multi-agent workflow, complex reasoning chain

    **SpanType.AGENT**: Autonomous agent operations

    Examples: Planning steps, decision making, goal-oriented behaviors

    **SpanType.TOOL**: External tool or function calls

    Examples: API calls, database queries, file operations, calculations
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="other-types" label="Other Types">
    **SpanType.RERANKER**: Re-ranking operations for retrieved contexts

    **SpanType.UNKNOWN**: General operations that don't fit other categories

    *Custom types*: You can also define your own span types as strings for specialized operations
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Trace Structure Example

Let's examine how these concepts work together in a typical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application:

```
📋 Trace: "Answer User Question" (Root)
├── 🔍 Span: "Query Processing" (UNKNOWN)
│   ├── Input: "What are MLflow's key features?"
│   └── Output: "Processed query: 'mlflow features'"
├── 📚 Span: "Document Retrieval" (RETRIEVER)
│   ├── 🔗 Span: "Embedding Generation" (EMBEDDING)
│   │   ├── Input: "mlflow features"
│   │   └── Output: [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ...] (vector)
│   └── 🗄️ Span: "Vector Search" (TOOL)
│       ├── Input: {query_vector, top_k: 5}
│       └── Output: [Document(...), Document(...)] (5 docs)
├── 🧠 Span: "Response Generation" (CHAIN)
│   ├── 📝 Span: "Prompt Building" (UNKNOWN)
│   │   ├── Input: {documents, user_query}
│   │   └── Output: "Based on these docs: ... Answer: ..."
│   └── 🤖 Span: "LLM Call" (CHAT_MODEL)
│       ├── Input: {messages, model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.7}
│       └── Output: "MLflow's key features include..."
└── ✅ Span: "Response Formatting" (UNKNOWN)
    ├── Input: "MLflow's key features include..."
    └── Output: {formatted_response, metadata}
```

Each span captures specific information relevant to its operation type, and the hierarchical structure shows the logical flow of the application.

## Observability Benefits

Understanding these concepts enables several powerful observability capabilities:

### Debugging
**Root cause analysis**: Trace the exact path that led to an error or unexpected result

**Performance bottlenecks**: Identify which operations consume the most time using precise nanosecond timing

**Data flow validation**: Verify that data is transformed correctly at each step by examining inputs and outputs

### Optimization
**Cost tracking**: Monitor token usage, API calls, and resource consumption across operations using span attributes

**Latency analysis**: Understand where delays occur in your application with detailed timing data

**Quality correlation**: Connect input quality (e.g., retrieval relevance scores) to output quality

### Monitoring
**System health**: Track success rates and error patterns across different components using span status

**Usage patterns**: Understand how users interact with your application through trace metadata

**Trend analysis**: Monitor performance and quality changes over time using trace history

## Specialized Schemas

Some span types have specialized schemas that enable enhanced functionality:

### Retriever Spans
For `RETRIEVER` spans, the output should conform to a `List[Document]` structure:
- **page_content**: The text content of the document
- **metadata**: Additional context including `doc_uri` for links and `chunk_id` for evaluation

This enables rich document display in the UI and proper evaluation metric calculation.

### Chat Model Spans
For `CHAT_MODEL` and `LLM` spans, special attributes provide enhanced conversation display:
- **mlflow.chat.messages**: Structured conversation data for rich UI rendering
- **mlflow.chat.tools**: Available tools for function calling scenarios

These attributes can be set using helper functions like <APILink fn="mlflow.tracing.set_span_chat_messages" />.

## Use Cases


<Tabs>

<TabItem value="genai-applications" label="GenAI Applications">

## GenAI ChatCompletions Use Case

In Generative AI (GenAI) applications, such as chat completions, tracing becomes essential for developers building GenAI-powered applications. These applications involve generating human-like text based on input prompts, and tracing provides visibility into the entire interaction context.

![GenAI ChatCompletions Architecture](/images/llms/tracing/chat-completions-architecture.png)

### What Tracing Captures

Enabling tracing on chat interfaces allows you to evaluate:

- **Full Contextual History**: Complete conversation context
- **Prompt Engineering**: How prompts are constructed and modified
- **Input Processing**: User input validation and preprocessing
- **Configuration Parameters**: Model settings and their effects
- **Output Generation**: Response quality and characteristics

### Key Metadata for ChatCompletions

Additional metadata surrounding the inference process is useful for various reasons:

- **Token Counts**: Number of tokens processed (affects billing and performance)
- **Model Name**: Specific model used for inference
- **Provider Type**: Service or platform providing the model (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Query Parameters**: Settings like temperature, top-k, max_tokens
- **Query Input**: The request input (user question)
- **Query Response**: System-generated response
- **Latency**: Time taken for each operation
- **Cost**: API costs associated with the request

### Example: Enhanced Chat Application

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI
import time


@mlflow.trace
def enhanced_chat_completion(user_message, conversation_history=None):
    start_time = time.time()

    # Add context to the trace
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "application": "customer_support_chat",
            "user_type": "premium",
            "conversation_length": len(conversation_history or []),
        }
    )

    # Prepare messages with history
    messages = conversation_history or []
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})

    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=500
    )

    # Add performance metrics
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "response_time_seconds": time.time() - start_time,
            "token_count": response.usage.total_tokens,
            "model_used": response.model,
        }
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Applications

In more complex applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tracing becomes essential for effective debugging and optimization. RAG involves multiple stages, including document retrieval, embedding, and interaction with GenAI models.

![RAG Architecture](/images/llms/tracing/rag-architecture.png)

### The Challenge Without Tracing

When only the input and output are visible, it becomes challenging to identify the source of issues. If a GenAI system generates an unsatisfactory response, the problem might lie in:

- **Vector Store Optimization**: Efficiency and accuracy of document retrieval
- **Embedding Model**: Quality of the model used to encode and search documents
- **Reference Material**: Content and quality of the documents being queried
- **Query Processing**: How user queries are transformed for retrieval
- **Context Assembly**: How retrieved documents are combined with the prompt

### Critical Steps in RAG (Often Hidden)

Without tracing, these steps are effectively a "black box":

1. **Embedding of the input query**
2. **The return of the encoded query vector**
3. **The vector search input**
4. **The retrieved document chunks from the Vector Database**
5. **The final input to the GenAI model**

### Example: Traced RAG Application

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI
import numpy as np


@mlflow.trace
def rag_chat_completion(user_question, vector_store):
    # Tag the trace for RAG-specific monitoring
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "application_type": "rag",
            "vector_store_type": "chromadb",
            "retrieval_strategy": "semantic_search",
        }
    )

    # Step 1: Embed the user question
    embedded_question = embed_query(user_question)

    # Step 2: Retrieve relevant documents
    relevant_docs = retrieve_documents(embedded_question, vector_store)

    # Step 3: Generate response with context
    response = generate_with_context(user_question, relevant_docs)

    return response


@mlflow.trace
def embed_query(query):
    """Convert user query to vector embedding."""
    # Embedding logic here
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "query_length": len(query),
            "embedding_model": "text-embedding-ada-002",
        }
    )
    # Return embedding vector
    return np.random.rand(1536)  # Placeholder


@mlflow.trace
def retrieve_documents(query_embedding, vector_store, top_k=5):
    """Retrieve relevant documents from vector store."""
    # Vector search logic here
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={"top_k": top_k, "search_type": "cosine_similarity"}
    )

    # Simulate document retrieval
    documents = [
        {"content": "Document 1 content...", "score": 0.85},
        {"content": "Document 2 content...", "score": 0.82},
    ]

    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "documents_found": len(documents),
            "avg_relevance_score": sum(d["score"] for d in documents) / len(documents),
        }
    )

    return documents


@mlflow.trace
def generate_with_context(question, documents):
    """Generate answer using retrieved context."""
    # Prepare context from documents
    context = "\n".join([doc["content"] for doc in documents])

    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={"context_length": len(context), "num_context_docs": len(documents)}
    )

    # Generate response with context
    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": f"Answer based on this context: {context}"},
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Benefits of RAG Tracing

With this tracing setup, you can:

- **Debug Retrieval Issues**: See exactly which documents were retrieved and their relevance scores
- **Optimize Embedding**: Monitor embedding quality and performance
- **Tune Context Assembly**: Understand how context affects generation quality
- **Monitor Performance**: Track latency at each stage of the pipeline
- **Analyze Failures**: Identify which component caused issues

## Beyond GenAI: Tracing for Traditional Machine Learning

:::note
While this documentation focuses on GenAI applications where tracing provides the most value, MLflow Tracing can also be applied to traditional ML workflows for monitoring and performance analysis.
:::

In traditional ML, the inference process is relatively straightforward compared to GenAI applications. When a request is made, input data is fed into the model, which processes the data and generates a prediction.

![Traditional ML Inference Architecture](/images/llms/tracing/tracing-traditional-ml.png)

### Traditional ML Characteristics

- **Transparent Process**: Both input and output are clearly defined and understandable
- **Deterministic**: Same input typically produces the same output
- **Single Model**: Usually involves one primary model for prediction
- **Structured Data**: Often works with tabular or well-defined data formats

### Example: Spam Detection Model

```python
# Input: Email text
email_text = "Congratulations! You've won $1000. Click here to claim..."

# Output: Binary classification
is_spam = True  # or False
```

This process is wholly visible - the email content and spam/not-spam label are both interpretable.

### When Tracing Helps in Traditional ML

While qualitative model performance assessment may not require tracing, it can still provide value for:

#### 1. Performance Monitoring
```python
import mlflow
import time


@mlflow.trace
def predict_fraud(transaction_data):
    start_time = time.time()

    # Preprocess the data
    processed_data = preprocess_transaction(transaction_data)

    # Make prediction
    prediction = fraud_model.predict(processed_data)

    # Log performance metrics
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "prediction_time_ms": (time.time() - start_time) * 1000,
            "model_version": "v2.1.0",
            "confidence_score": prediction.probability,
        }
    )

    return prediction
```

#### 2. API Access Logging
```python
@mlflow.trace
def ml_api_endpoint(request_data, user_id):
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={"user_id": user_id, "api_version": "v1", "endpoint": "/predict"}
    )

    # Process request and return prediction
    result = make_prediction(request_data)

    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "request_size_bytes": len(str(request_data)),
            "response_size_bytes": len(str(result)),
        }
    )

    return result
```

#### 3. Multi-Model Pipelines
```python
@mlflow.trace
def ensemble_prediction(input_data):
    # Use multiple models in sequence
    preprocessed = preprocessing_model(input_data)
    features = feature_extraction_model(preprocessed)
    prediction = final_model(features)

    return prediction
```

### Differences from GenAI Tracing

| Aspect | Traditional ML | GenAI Applications |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple input → output | Multi-step, contextual processes |
| **Transparency** | High (interpretable I/O) | Low (complex internal processing) |
| **Debugging Need** | Performance & infrastructure | Quality, relevance, hallucinations |
| **Trace Value** | Operational monitoring | Essential for development & debugging |
