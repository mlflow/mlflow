# Delete Traces

You can delete traces based on specific criteria using the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.delete_traces" /> method. This method allows you to delete traces by **experiment ID**, **maximum timestamp**, or **trace IDs**.

:::tip
Deleting a trace is an irreversible process. Ensure that the parameters provided to the `delete_traces` API meet the intended range for deletion.

## Deletion Methods

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="by-timestamp" label="By Timestamp" default>
    Delete traces older than a specific timestamp:

    ```python
    import time
    from mlflow import MlflowClient

    client = MlflowClient()

    # Get current timestamp in milliseconds
    current_time = int(time.time() * 1000)

    # Delete traces older than current time, limit to 100 traces
    deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
        experiment_id="1", max_timestamp_millis=current_time, max_traces=100
    )

    print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} traces")
    ```

    **Delete traces older than a specific time period:**

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    # Calculate timestamp for 7 days ago
    seven_days_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
    timestamp_ms = int(seven_days_ago.timestamp() * 1000)

    deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
        experiment_id="1", max_timestamp_millis=timestamp_ms
    )
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="by-trace-ids" label="By Trace IDs">
    Delete specific traces by their trace IDs:

    ```python
    from mlflow import MlflowClient

    client = MlflowClient()

    # Delete specific traces
    trace_ids = ["trace_id_1", "trace_id_2", "trace_id_3"]

    deleted_count = client.delete_traces(experiment_id="1", trace_ids=trace_ids)

    print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} traces")
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="batch-deletion" label="Batch Deletion">
    Delete traces in batches for better performance:

    ```python
    import time
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from mlflow import MlflowClient


    def cleanup_old_traces(experiment_id: str, days_old: int = 30, batch_size: int = 100):
        """Delete traces older than specified days in batches"""
        client = MlflowClient()

        # Calculate cutoff timestamp
        cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days_old)
        cutoff_timestamp = int(cutoff_date.timestamp() * 1000)

        total_deleted = 0

        while True:
            deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
                experiment_id=experiment_id,
                max_timestamp_millis=cutoff_timestamp,
                max_traces=batch_size,
            )

            total_deleted += deleted_count
            print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} traces (total: {total_deleted})")

            if deleted_count < batch_size:
                break

            time.sleep(0.1)  # Brief pause between batches

        return total_deleted


    # Usage
    cleanup_old_traces(experiment_id="1", days_old=7)
    ```

  </TabItem>

## Advanced Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="selective-cleanup" label="Selective Cleanup" default>
    Delete traces based on specific criteria:

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow import MlflowClient


    def delete_error_traces(experiment_id: str):
        """Delete only traces that resulted in errors"""
        client = MlflowClient()

        # Search for error traces
        traces = mlflow.search_traces(
            experiment_ids=[experiment_id],
            filter_string="status = 'ERROR'",
            max_results=1000,

            trace_ids = [trace.info.trace_id for trace in traces]
            deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
                experiment_id=experiment_id, trace_ids=trace_ids
            )
            print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} error traces")
            return deleted_count

        return 0


    # Usage
    delete_error_traces("1")
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dry-run" label="Dry Run Mode">
    Test deletion criteria before actual deletion:

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow import MlflowClient


    def delete_with_dry_run(experiment_id: str, max_timestamp: int, dry_run: bool = True):
        """Delete traces with optional dry-run mode"""
        client = MlflowClient()

        if dry_run:
            # Search to see what would be deleted
            traces = mlflow.search_traces(
                experiment_ids=[experiment_id], filter_string=f"timestamp < {max_timestamp}"
            )
            print(f"DRY RUN: Would delete {len(traces)} traces")
            return len(traces)
        else:
            deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
                experiment_id=experiment_id,
                max_timestamp_millis=max_timestamp,
                max_traces=1000,
            )
            print(f"ACTUAL: Deleted {deleted_count} traces")
            return deleted_count


    # Always test with dry run first
    count = delete_with_dry_run("1", 1234567890000, dry_run=True)
    if count < 100:  # Only proceed if reasonable number
        delete_with_dry_run("1", 1234567890000, dry_run=False)
    ```

        """Delete traces with error handling"""
        client = MlflowClient()

        try:
            deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
                experiment_id=experiment_id, **delete_params

            else:
                print(f"MLflow error: {e}")
            return 0

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            return 0


    # Usage
    safe_delete_traces("1", max_timestamp_millis=1234567890000, max_traces=50)
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

**Always test first**: Use search queries or dry-run mode to verify which traces will be deleted before proceeding.

**Delete in batches**: For large numbers of traces, delete in smaller batches to avoid timeouts and performance issues.

**Set reasonable limits**: Use the `max_traces` parameter to prevent accidentally deleting too many traces at once.

**Monitor and log**: Keep track of deletion activities for audit purposes, especially in production environments.

**Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling to manage network issues, permission problems, or invalid parameters.

## Parameters Reference

| Parameter              | Type      | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `experiment_id`        | str       | **Required.** The ID of the experiment containing traces to delete |
| `max_timestamp_millis` | int       | Delete traces created before this timestamp (in milliseconds)      |
| `trace_ids`            | List[str] | Delete traces with these specific trace IDs                        |
| `max_traces`           | int       | Maximum number of traces to delete in this operation               |

:::note
You must specify either `max_timestamp_millis` or `trace_ids`, but not both. The `max_traces` parameter cannot be used with `trace_ids`.
