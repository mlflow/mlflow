# Delete Traces


You can delete traces based on specific criteria using the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.delete_traces" /> method. This method allows you to delete traces by **experiment ID**, **maximum timestamp**, or **trace IDs**.

:::tip
Deleting a trace is an irreversible process. Ensure that the parameters provided to the `delete_traces` API meet the intended range for deletion.

## Deletion Methods

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="by-timestamp" label="By Timestamp" default>
    Delete traces older than a specific timestamp:

    ```python
    import time
    from mlflow import MlflowClient

    client = MlflowClient()

    # Get current timestamp in milliseconds
    current_time = int(time.time() * 1000)

    # Delete traces older than current time, limit to 100 traces
    deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
        experiment_id="1", max_timestamp_millis=current_time, max_traces=100
    )

    print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} traces")
    ```

    **Delete traces older than a specific time period:**

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    # Calculate timestamp for 7 days ago
    seven_days_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
    timestamp_ms = int(seven_days_ago.timestamp() * 1000)

    deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
        experiment_id="1", max_timestamp_millis=timestamp_ms
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="by-trace-ids" label="By Trace IDs">
    Delete specific traces by their trace IDs:

    ```python
    from mlflow import MlflowClient

    client = MlflowClient()

    # Delete specific traces
    trace_ids = ["trace_id_1", "trace_id_2", "trace_id_3"]

    deleted_count = client.delete_traces(experiment_id="1", trace_ids=trace_ids)

    print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} traces")
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="batch-deletion" label="Batch Deletion">
    Delete traces in batches for better performance:

    ```python
    import time
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from mlflow import MlflowClient


    def cleanup_old_traces(experiment_id: str, days_old: int = 30, batch_size: int = 100):
        """Delete traces older than specified days in batches"""
        client = MlflowClient()

        # Calculate cutoff timestamp
        cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days_old)
        cutoff_timestamp = int(cutoff_date.timestamp() * 1000)

        total_deleted = 0

        while True:
            deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
                experiment_id=experiment_id,
                max_timestamp_millis=cutoff_timestamp,
                max_traces=batch_size,
            )

            total_deleted += deleted_count
            print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} traces (total: {total_deleted})")

            if deleted_count < batch_size:
                break

            time.sleep(0.1)  # Brief pause between batches

        return total_deleted


    # Usage
    cleanup_old_traces(experiment_id="1", days_old=7)
    ```

    # Always test with dry run first
    count = delete_with_dry_run("1", 1234567890000, dry_run=True)
    if count < 100:  # Only proceed if reasonable number

        """Delete traces with error handling"""

    safe_delete_traces("1", max_timestamp_millis=1234567890000, max_traces=50)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

**Always test first**: Use search queries or dry-run mode to verify which traces will be deleted before proceeding.

**Delete in batches**: For large numbers of traces, delete in smaller batches to avoid timeouts and performance issues.

**Set reasonable limits**: Use the `max_traces` parameter to prevent accidentally deleting too many traces at once.

**Monitor and log**: Keep track of deletion activities for audit purposes, especially in production environments.

**Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling to manage network issues, permission problems, or invalid parameters.

## Parameters Reference

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `experiment_id` | str | **Required.** The ID of the experiment containing traces to delete |
| `max_timestamp_millis` | int | Delete traces created before this timestamp (in milliseconds) |
| `trace_ids` | List[str] | Delete traces with these specific trace IDs |
| `max_traces` | int | Maximum number of traces to delete in this operation |

:::note
You must specify either `max_timestamp_millis` or `trace_ids`, but not both. The `max_traces` parameter cannot be used with `trace_ids`.
