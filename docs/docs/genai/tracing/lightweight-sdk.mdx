# Lightweight Tracing SDK Optimized for Production Usage

MLflow offers a lightweight tracing SDK package called `mlflow-tracing` that includes only the essential functionality for tracing and monitoring of your GenAI applications. This package is designed for production environments where minimizing dependencies and deployment size is critical.

## Why Use the Lightweight SDK?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <TitleCard
        title="🏎️ Faster Deployment"
        description="The package size and dependencies are significantly smaller than the full MLflow package, allowing for faster deployment times in dynamic environments such as Docker containers, serverless functions, and cloud-based applications."
    />
    <TitleCard
        title="🔧 Simplified Dependency Management"
        description="A smaller set of dependencies means less work keeping up with dependency updates, security patches, and potential breaking changes from upstream libraries. It also reduces the chances of dependency collisions and incompatibilities."
    />
    <TitleCard
        title="📦 Enhanced Portability"
        description="With fewer dependencies, MLflow Tracing can be seamlessly deployed across different environments and platforms, without worrying about compatibility issues."
    />
    <TitleCard
        title="🔒 Reduced Security Risk"
        description="Each dependency potentially introduces security vulnerabilities. By reducing the number of dependencies, MLflow Tracing minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of security breaches."
    />
</CardGroup>

## Installation

Install the lightweight SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install mlflow-tracing
```

:::warning
Do not install the full `mlflow` package together with the lightweight `mlflow-tracing` SDK, as this may cause version conflicts and namespace resolution issues.
:::

## Quickstart

Here's a simple example using the lightweight SDK with OpenAI for logging traces to an experiment on a remote MLflow server:

```python
import mlflow
import openai

# Set the tracking URI to your MLflow server
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://your-mlflow-server:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("genai-production-monitoring")

# Enable auto-tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Use OpenAI as usual - traces will be automatically logged
client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is MLflow?"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Choose Your Backend

The lightweight SDK works with various observability platforms. Choose your preferred option and follow the instructions to set up your tracing backend.

    <div class="flex-column">
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item">

          MLflow is a **fully open-source project**, allowing you to self-host your own MLflow server in your own infrastructure. This is a great option if you want to have full control over your data and are restricted in using cloud-based services.

          In self-hosting mode, you will be responsible for running the tracking server instance and scaling it to your needs. We **strongly recommend** using a SQL-based tracking server on top of a performant database to minimize operational overhead and ensure high availability.

          **Setup Steps:**
          1. Install MLflow server: `pip install mlflow[extras]`
          2. Configure backend store (PostgreSQL/MySQL recommended)
          3. Configure artifact store (S3, Azure Blob, GCS, etc.)
          4. Start server: `mlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql://... --default-artifact-root s3://...`

          Refer to the [tracking server setup guide](/ml/tracking#tracking-setup) for detailed guidance.

          MLflow Tracing is **built on the OpenTelemetry tracing spec**, an industry-standard framework for observability, making it a vendor-neutral solution for monitoring your GenAI applications.

          If you are using OpenTelemetry as part of your observability tech stack, you can use MLflow Tracing without any additional service onboarding. Simply configure the OTLP endpoint and MLflow will export traces to your existing observability platform.

          **Setup Example:**
          ```bash
          export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="http://your-collector:4317/v1/traces"
          export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="genai-app"

</CardGroup>

## Production Configuration Example

Here's a complete example of setting up the lightweight SDK for production use:

```python
import mlflow
import os
from your_app import process_user_request

# Configure MLflow for production
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(os.getenv("MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI", "http://mlflow-server:5000"))
mlflow.set_experiment(os.getenv("MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME", "production-genai-app"))

# Enable automatic tracing for your LLM library
mlflow.openai.autolog()  # or mlflow.langchain.autolog(), etc.


@mlflow.trace
def handle_user_request(user_id: str, session_id: str, message: str):
    """Production endpoint with comprehensive tracing."""

    # Add production context to trace
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "user_id": user_id,
            "session_id": session_id,
            "environment": "production",
            "service_version": os.getenv("SERVICE_VERSION", "1.0.0"),
        }
    )

    try:
        # Your application logic here
        response = process_user_request(message)

        # Log success metrics
        mlflow.update_current_trace(
            tags={"response_length": len(response), "processing_successful": True}
        )

        return response

    except Exception as e:
        # Log error information
        mlflow.update_current_trace(
            tags={
                "error": True,
                "error_type": type(e).__name__,
                "error_message": str(e),
            },
        )
        raise
```

## Features Not Included

The following MLflow features are not available in the lightweight package:

- **MLflow Tracking Server and UI** - Use the full MLflow package to run the server
- **Run Management APIs** - `mlflow.start_run()`, `mlflow.log_metric()`, etc.
- **Model Logging and Evaluation** - Model serialization and evaluation frameworks
- **Model Registry** - Model versioning and lifecycle management
- **MLflow Projects** - Reproducible ML project format
- **MLflow Recipes** - Predefined ML workflows
- **Other MLflow Components** - Features unrelated to tracing

For these features, use the full MLflow package: `pip install mlflow`

## Migration from Full MLflow

If you're currently using the full MLflow package and want to switch to the lightweight SDK for production:

### 1. Update Dependencies

```bash
# Remove full MLflow
pip uninstall mlflow

# Install lightweight SDK
pip install mlflow-tracing
```

### 2. Update Import Statements

Most tracing functionality remains the same:

```python
# These imports work the same way
import mlflow
import mlflow.openai
from mlflow.tracing import trace

# These features are NOT available in mlflow-tracing:
# import mlflow.sklearn  # ❌ Model logging
# mlflow.start_run()     # ❌ Run management
# mlflow.log_metric()    # ❌ Metric logging
```

### 3. Update Configuration

Focus on tracing-specific configuration:

```python
# Configure tracking URI (same as before)
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://your-server:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("your-experiment")


# Tracing works the same way
@mlflow.trace
def your_function():
    # Your code here
    pass
```

## Package Size Comparison

| Package | Size | Dependencies | Use Case |
|---------|------|--------------|----------|
| `mlflow` | ~1000MB | 20+ packages | Development, experimentation, full ML lifecycle |
| `mlflow-tracing` | ~5MB | 5-8 packages | Production tracing, monitoring, observability |

The lightweight SDK is **95% smaller** than the full MLflow package, making it ideal for:
- Container deployments
- Serverless functions
- Edge computing
- Production microservices
- CI/CD pipelines

## Summary

The MLflow Tracing SDK provides a production-optimized solution for monitoring GenAI applications with:

- **Minimal footprint** for fast deployments
- **Full tracing capabilities** for comprehensive monitoring
- **Flexible backend options** from self-hosted to enterprise platforms
- **Easy migration path** from full MLflow package
- **Production-ready features** including async logging and error handling

Whether you're running a small prototype or a large-scale production system, the lightweight SDK provides the observability you need without the overhead you don't.
