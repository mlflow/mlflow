# Production Monitoring for GenAI Applications

<DatabricksCallout docsPath="/mlflow3/genai/tracing/prod-tracing" />

Machine learning projects don't conclude with their initial launch. Ongoing monitoring and incremental enhancements are critical for long-term success. MLflow Tracing offers comprehensive observability for your production applications, supporting the iterative process of continuous improvement while ensuring quality delivery to users.

GenAI applications face unique challenges that make production monitoring essential. Quality drift can occur over time due to model updates, data distribution shifts, or new user interaction patterns. The operational complexity of multi-step workflows involving LLMs, vector databases, and retrieval systems creates multiple potential failure points that need continuous oversight. Cost management becomes critical as token usage and API costs can vary significantly based on user behavior and model performance.

## Prerequisites for Production Deployments

For production deployments, it is highly recommended to install the lightweight `mlflow-tracing` package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mlflow-tracing
```

### Pro Tip: Using the Lightweight Tracing SDK

The [MLflow Tracing SDK `mlflow-tracing`](/genai/tracing/lightweight-sdk) is a lightweight package that only includes the minimum set of dependencies to instrument your code/models/agents with MLflow Tracing.

:::warning Compatibility Warning
When installing the MLflow Tracing SDK, make sure the environment **does not have** the full MLflow package installed. Having both packages in the same environment might cause conflicts and unexpected behaviors.
:::

**Production vs Development Packages:**
- **Production** (`mlflow-tracing`): Minimal dependencies, performance optimized, client-side tracing only
- **Development** (`mlflow`): Full MLflow features including UI, evaluations, experimentation tools

:::note
MLflow 3 (specifically `mlflow-tracing` for production) is required for production tracing. MLflow 2.x is **not supported for production deployments** due to performance limitations and missing features essential for production use.

## Setting Up Tracing for Production Endpoints

When deploying your GenAI application to production, you need to configure MLflow Tracing to send traces to your MLflow tracking server. This configuration forms the foundation for all production observability capabilities.

### Environment Variable Configuration

Configure the following environment variables in your production environment:

```bash
# Required: Set MLflow Tracking URI
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://your-mlflow-server:5000"

# Optional: Configure the experiment name for organizing traces
export MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME="production-genai-app"

# Optional: Configure async logging (recommended for production)
export MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_WORKERS=10
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=1000
```

### Docker Deployment Example

When deploying with Docker, pass environment variables through your container configuration:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Set default environment variables (can be overridden at runtime)
ENV MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=""
ENV MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME="production-genai-app"
ENV MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Run the container with environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://your-mlflow-server:5000" \
  -e MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME="production-genai-app" \
  -e MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true \
  -e APP_VERSION="1.0.0" \
  your-app:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment Example

For Kubernetes deployments, use ConfigMaps and Secrets:

```yaml
# configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mlflow-config
data:
  MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI: 'http://mlflow-server:5000'
  MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME: 'production-genai-app'
  MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING: 'true'

---
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: genai-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: your-app:latest
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: mlflow-config
          env:
            - name: APP_VERSION
              value: '1.0.0'
```

### Databricks Model Serving Integration

When you deploy GenAI applications that have been instrumented with MLflow Tracing through the Mosaic AI Agent Framework, MLflow Tracing works automatically without any additional configuration. This integration provides seamless observability from development to production deployment.

**Automatic Trace Collection**: If your code uses MLflow Tracing decorators, context managers, or autologging, traces are captured automatically in production with the same code working seamlessly across environments.

**Built-in Production Readiness**: The framework handles trace batching, sampling, and error handling for production workloads while automatically logging traces to your specified MLflow experiment.

```python
import mlflow
from databricks.agents import deploy


# Your instrumented agent code
@mlflow.trace
def my_agent(query: str) -> str:
    # Agent logic with automatic tracing
    return process_query(query)


# Deploy with automatic trace collection
deployed_agent = deploy(model=my_agent, experiment_name="production-agent-traces")
```

### Verifying Trace Collection

After deployment, verify that traces are being collected properly:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.client import MlflowClient
import os

# Check connection to MLflow server
client = MlflowClient()
try:
    # List recent experiments to verify connectivity
    experiments = client.search_experiments()
    print(f"Connected to MLflow. Found {len(experiments)} experiments.")

    # Check if traces are being logged
    traces = mlflow.search_traces(
        experiment_names=[os.getenv("MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME", "production-genai-app")],
        max_results=5,
    )
    print(f"Found {len(traces)} recent traces.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error connecting to MLflow: {e}")
    print(f"Check your tracking URI and connectivity")
```

## Adding Context to Production Traces

In production environments, enriching traces with contextual information is crucial for understanding user behavior, debugging issues, and improving your GenAI application. This context enables you to analyze user interactions, track quality across different segments, and identify patterns that lead to better or worse outcomes.

### Tracking Request, Session, and User Context

Production applications need to track multiple pieces of context simultaneously. Here's a comprehensive example showing how to track all of these in a FastAPI application:

```python
import mlflow
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()


class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str


@mlflow.trace  # Ensure @mlflow.trace is the outermost decorator
@app.post("/chat")  # FastAPI decorator should be inner
def handle_chat(request: Request, chat_request: ChatRequest):
    # Retrieve all context from request headers
    client_request_id = request.headers.get("X-Request-ID")
    session_id = request.headers.get("X-Session-ID")
    user_id = request.headers.get("X-User-ID")

    # Update the current trace with all context and environment metadata
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        client_request_id=client_request_id,
        tags={
            # Session context - groups traces from multi-turn conversations
            "mlflow.trace.session": session_id,
            # User context - associates traces with specific users
            "mlflow.trace.user": user_id,
            # Environment metadata - tracks deployment context
            "environment": "production",
            "app_version": os.getenv("APP_VERSION", "1.0.0"),
            "deployment_id": os.getenv("DEPLOYMENT_ID", "unknown"),
            "region": os.getenv("REGION", "us-east-1"),
        },
    )

    # Your application logic for processing the chat message
    response_text = f"Processed message: '{chat_request.message}'"

    return {"response": response_text}
```

### Feedback Collection

Capturing user feedback on specific interactions is essential for understanding quality and improving your GenAI application:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.client import MlflowClient
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
from mlflow.entities import AssessmentSource

app = FastAPI()


class FeedbackRequest(BaseModel):
    is_correct: bool  # True for correct, False for incorrect
    comment: Optional[str] = None


@app.post("/chat_feedback")
def handle_chat_feedback(
    request: Request,
    client_request_id: str = Query(
        ..., description="The client request ID from the original chat request"
    ),
    feedback: FeedbackRequest = ...,
):
    """
    Collect user feedback for a specific chat interaction identified by client_request_id.
    """
    # Search for the trace with the matching client_request_id
    client = MlflowClient()
    experiment = client.get_experiment_by_name("production-genai-app")
    traces = client.search_traces(
        experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
        filter_string=f"attributes.client_request_id = '{client_request_id}'",
        max_results=1,
    )

    if not traces:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "message": f"Unable to find data for client request ID: {client_request_id}",
        }, 500

    # Log feedback using MLflow's log_feedback API
    mlflow.log_feedback(
        trace_id=traces[0].info.trace_id,
        name="response_is_correct",
        value=feedback.is_correct,
        source=AssessmentSource(
            source_type="HUMAN", source_id=request.headers.get("X-User-ID")
        ),
        rationale=feedback.comment,
    )

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Feedback recorded successfully",
        "trace_id": traces[0].info.trace_id,
    }
```

### Querying Traces with Context

Use the contextual information to analyze production behavior:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.client import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
experiment = client.get_experiment_by_name("production-genai-app")

# Query traces by user
user_traces = client.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
    filter_string="tags.`mlflow.trace.user` = 'user-jane-doe-12345'",
    max_results=100,
)

# Query traces by session
session_traces = client.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
    filter_string="tags.`mlflow.trace.session` = 'session-def-456'",
    max_results=100,
)

# Query traces by environment
production_traces = client.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
    filter_string="tags.environment = 'production'",
    max_results=100,
)
```

## Key Monitoring Areas

Understanding what to monitor helps you focus on metrics that actually impact user experience and business outcomes. Rather than trying to monitor everything, focus on areas that provide actionable insights for your specific application and user base.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="operational" label="Operational Metrics" default>
    **Performance and Reliability**: Monitor end-to-end response times from user request to final response, including LLM inference latency, retrieval system performance, and component-level bottlenecks. Track overall error rates, LLM API failures, timeout occurrences, and dependency failures to maintain system reliability.

    **Resource Utilization**: Monitor token consumption patterns, API cost tracking, request throughput, and system resource usage to optimize performance and control costs.

    **Business Metrics**: Track user engagement rates, session completion rates, feature adoption, and user satisfaction scores to understand the business impact of your application.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="quality" label="Quality Metrics">
    **Response Quality**: Assess response relevance to user queries, factual accuracy, completeness of responses, and consistency across similar queries to ensure your application meets user needs.

    **Safety and Compliance**: Monitor for harmful content detection, bias monitoring, privacy compliance, and regulatory adherence, which is especially important for applications in regulated industries.

    **User Experience Quality**: Track response helpfulness, clarity and readability, appropriate tone and style, and multi-turn conversation quality to optimize user satisfaction.

    **Domain-Specific Quality**: Implement metrics that vary by application type, such as technical accuracy for specialized domains, citation quality for RAG applications, code quality for programming assistants, or creative quality for content generation.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="business" label="Business Impact">
    **User Behavior**: Monitor session duration and depth, feature usage patterns, user retention rates, and conversion metrics to understand how users engage with your application.

    **Operational Efficiency**: Track support ticket reduction, process automation success, time savings for users, and task completion rates to measure operational improvements.

    **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compare infrastructure costs versus value delivered, ROI on GenAI investment, productivity improvements, and customer satisfaction impact to justify and optimize your GenAI initiatives.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Production Insights from Traces

Production traces provide valuable insights across multiple dimensions that aren't visible during development. These insights help you understand real-world usage patterns and identify opportunities for improvement.

**User Interaction Analysis**: Real user queries often differ significantly from test cases, revealing the complexity and variety of actual use cases. Conversation patterns in multi-turn interactions show how well your application maintains context and handles follow-up questions. Query complexity distribution helps you understand whether your application handles the full range of user needs effectively.

**Performance and Reliability Monitoring**: Error pattern analysis reveals systemic issues that may not be apparent from individual failures. Latency monitoring across different components helps you optimize response times and identify bottlenecks. Resource usage tracking enables cost optimization and capacity planning.

**Quality and Feedback Insights**: User feedback provides direct insight into how well your application meets real needs. Quality trends over time reveal whether changes to your application actually improve user experience. Behavioral pattern analysis helps identify usage patterns that lead to better outcomes.

## Production Monitoring Configurations

### Asynchronous Trace Logging

For production applications, MLflow logs traces asynchronously by default to prevent blocking your application:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING` | Whether to log traces asynchronously. When set to `False`, traces will be logged in a blocking manner. | `True` |
| `MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_WORKERS` | The maximum number of worker threads to use for async trace logging per process. Increasing this allows higher throughput of trace logging, but also increases CPU usage and memory consumption. | `10` |
| `MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` | The maximum number of traces that can be queued before being logged to backend by the worker threads. When the queue is full, new traces will be discarded. Increasing this allows higher durability of trace logging, but also increases memory consumption. | `1000` |
| `MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_RETRY_TIMEOUT` | The timeout in seconds for retrying failed trace logging. When a trace logging fails, it will be retried up to this timeout with backoff, after which it will be discarded. | `500` |

Example configuration for high-volume applications:

```bash
export MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_WORKERS=20
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=2000
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_RETRY_TIMEOUT=600
```

## OpenTelemetry Integration

Traces generated by MLflow are compatible with the [OpenTelemetry trace specs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#span). Therefore, MLflow traces can be exported to various observability platforms that support OpenTelemetry.

By default, MLflow exports traces to the MLflow Tracking Server. To enable exporting traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable **before starting any trace**:

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```

```python
import mlflow
import os

# Set the endpoint of the OpenTelemetry Collector
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:4317/v1/traces"
# Optionally, set the service name to group traces
os.environ["OTEL_SERVICE_NAME"] = "your-service-name"

# Trace will be exported to the OTel collector
with mlflow.start_span(name="foo") as span:
    span.set_inputs({"a": 1})
    span.set_outputs({"b": 2})
```

</CardGroup>

### OpenTelemetry Configuration

MLflow uses the standard OTLP Exporter for exporting traces to OpenTelemetry Collector instances. You can use [all of the configurations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/) supported by OpenTelemetry:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317/v1/traces"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL="http/protobuf"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="api_key=12345"
```

:::warning Trace Exports
MLflow only exports traces to a single destination. When the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable is configured, MLflow will **not** export traces to the MLflow Tracking Server and you will not see traces in the MLflow UI.
:::

## Self-Hosted Tracking Server

You can use the MLflow tracking server to store production traces. However, the tracking server is optimized for offline experience and generally not suitable for handling hyper-scale traffic. For high-volume production workloads, consider using OpenTelemetry integration with dedicated observability platforms.

If you choose to use the tracking server in production, we **strongly recommend**:

1. **Use SQL-based tracking server** on top of a scalable database and artifact storage
2. **Configure proper indexing** on trace tables for better query performance
3. **Set up periodic deletion** for trace data management
4. **Monitor server performance** and scale appropriately

Refer to the [tracking server setup guide](/ml/tracking#tracking-setup) for more details.

### Performance Considerations

**Database**: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for better concurrent write performance rather than SQLite for production deployments.

**Storage**: Use cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS) for artifact storage to ensure scalability and reliability.

**Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on `timestamp_ms`, `status`, and frequently queried tag columns to maintain query performance as trace volume grows.

**Retention**: Implement data retention policies to manage storage costs and maintain system performance over time.

## Advanced Monitoring Capabilities

For organizations requiring comprehensive automated monitoring capabilities, Databricks Mosaic AI provides enterprise-grade solutions that go beyond basic trace collection. These capabilities are particularly valuable for large-scale deployments where manual monitoring becomes impractical.

**Automated Quality Assessment**: Run LLM judges and custom evaluators automatically on production traffic samples, providing continuous quality monitoring without manual intervention.

**Real-time Monitoring Dashboards**: Pre-built visualizations for operational metrics, quality trends, and business impact give teams immediate visibility into application performance.

**Intelligent Alerting Systems**: ML-powered anomaly detection combined with threshold-based alerts reduces false positives while ensuring critical issues are caught quickly.

**Cost Optimization Tools**: Advanced analytics for token usage, cost prediction, and budget management help organizations optimize their GenAI investments.

**Compliance and Safety Monitoring**: Automated detection of bias, harmful content, and regulatory compliance issues is essential for organizations operating in regulated industries.

## Production Monitoring Best Practices

### 1. Structured Logging and Tagging

Use consistent tagging schemes across your application to enable effective filtering and analysis:

```python
# Standard production tags
standard_tags = {
    "environment": os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "production"),
    "service_name": os.getenv("SERVICE_NAME", "genai-app"),
    "version": os.getenv("APP_VERSION", "1.0.0"),
    "region": os.getenv("REGION", "us-east-1"),
}


@mlflow.trace
def my_function():
    mlflow.update_current_trace(tags=standard_tags)
    # Your function logic
```

### 2. Error Handling and Monitoring

Implement robust error handling to ensure traces are logged even when failures occur:

```python
@mlflow.trace
def robust_function():
    try:
        # Your function logic
        result = process_request()
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error details to trace
        mlflow.update_current_trace(
            tags={"error": True, "error_type": type(e).__name__},
            attributes={"error_message": str(e)},
        )
        raise
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Track key performance metrics to understand system behavior and optimize performance:

```python
import time


@mlflow.trace
def performance_tracked_function():
    start_time = time.time()

    # Your function logic
    result = expensive_operation()

    # Log performance metrics
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        attributes={
            "duration_seconds": duration,
            "tokens_processed": len(result.split()) if isinstance(result, str) else 0,
        }
    )

    return result
```

### 4. Health Checks

Implement health checks to monitor trace logging and system connectivity:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from mlflow.client import MlflowClient

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/health")
def health_check():
    try:
        client = MlflowClient()
        # Quick connectivity test
        experiments = client.search_experiments(max_results=1)
        return {"status": "healthy", "mlflow_connected": True}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "mlflow_connected": False, "error": str(e)}
```
