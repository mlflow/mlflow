# Production Monitoring for GenAI Applications

Machine learning projects don't conclude with their initial launch. Ongoing monitoring and incremental enhancements are critical for long-term success. MLflow Tracing offers comprehensive observability for your production applications, supporting the iterative process of continuous improvement while ensuring quality delivery to users.

## Key Monitoring Areas

Understanding what to monitor helps you focus on metrics that actually impact user experience and business outcomes. Rather than trying to monitor everything, focus on areas that provide actionable insights for your specific application and user base.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="operational" label="Operational Metrics" default>
    **Performance and Reliability**: Monitor end-to-end response times from user request to final response, including LLM inference latency, retrieval system performance, and component-level bottlenecks. Track overall error rates, LLM API failures, timeout occurrences, and dependency failures to maintain system reliability.

    **Resource Utilization**: Monitor token consumption patterns, API cost tracking, request throughput, and system resource usage to optimize performance and control costs.

    **Business Metrics**: Track user engagement rates, session completion rates, feature adoption, and user satisfaction scores to understand the business impact of your application.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="quality" label="Quality Metrics">
    **Response Quality**: Assess response relevance to user queries, factual accuracy, completeness of responses, and consistency across similar queries to ensure your application meets user needs.

    **Safety and Compliance**: Monitor for harmful content detection, bias monitoring, privacy compliance, and regulatory adherence, which is especially important for applications in regulated industries.

    **User Experience Quality**: Track response helpfulness, clarity and readability, appropriate tone and style, and multi-turn conversation quality to optimize user satisfaction.

    **Domain-Specific Quality**: Implement metrics that vary by application type, such as technical accuracy for specialized domains, citation quality for RAG applications, code quality for programming assistants, or creative quality for content generation.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="business" label="Business Impact">
    **User Behavior**: Monitor session duration and depth, feature usage patterns, user retention rates, and conversion metrics to understand how users engage with your application.

    **Operational Efficiency**: Track support ticket reduction, process automation success, time savings for users, and task completion rates to measure operational improvements.

    **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compare infrastructure costs versus value delivered, ROI on GenAI investment, productivity improvements, and customer satisfaction impact to justify and optimize your GenAI initiatives.

### Environment Variable Configuration

Configure the following environment variables in your production environment. See [Production Monitoring Configurations](#production-monitoring-configurations) below for more details about these configurations.

```bash
# Required: Set MLflow Tracking URI
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://your-mlflow-server:5000"

# Optional: Configure the experiment name for organizing traces
export MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME="production-genai-app"

# Optional: Configure async logging (recommended for production)
export MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_WORKERS=10
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=1000

# Optional: Configure trace sampling ratio (default is 1.0)
export MLFLOW_TRACE_SAMPLING_RATIO=0.1
```

## Self-Hosted Tracking Server

You can use the MLflow tracking server to store production traces. However, the tracking server is optimized for offline experience and generally not suitable for handling hyper-scale traffic. For high-volume production workloads, consider using OpenTelemetry integration with dedicated observability platforms.

If you choose to use the tracking server in production, we **strongly recommend**:

1. **Use SQL-based tracking server** on top of a scalable database and artifact storage
2. **Configure proper indexing** on trace tables for better query performance
3. **Set up periodic deletion** for trace data management
4. **Monitor server performance** and scale appropriately

Refer to the [tracking server setup guide](/ml/tracking#tracking-setup) for more details.

### Performance Considerations

**Database**: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for better concurrent write performance rather than SQLite for production deployments.

**Storage**: Use cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS) for artifact storage to ensure scalability and reliability.

**Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on `timestamp_ms`, `status`, and frequently queried tag columns to maintain query performance as trace volume grows.

**Retention**: Implement data retention policies to manage storage costs and maintain system performance over time.

### Docker Deployment Example

When deploying with Docker, pass environment variables through your container configuration:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Set default environment variables (can be overridden at runtime)
ENV MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=""
ENV MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME="production-genai-app"
ENV MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Run the container with environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://your-mlflow-server:5000" \
  -e MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME="production-genai-app" \
  -e MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true \
  -e APP_VERSION="1.0.0" \
  your-app:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment Example

For Kubernetes deployments, use ConfigMaps and Secrets:

```yaml
# configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mlflow-config
data:
  MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI: 'http://mlflow-server:5000'
  MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME: 'production-genai-app'
  MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING: 'true'

---
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: genai-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: your-app:latest
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: mlflow-config
          env:
            - name: APP_VERSION
              value: '1.0.0'
```

## OpenTelemetry Backends

MLflow Traces can be exported to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. See the [OpenTelemetry Integration](/genai/tracing/opentelemetry/export) documentation for more details.

## Managed Monitoring with Databricks

Databricks also offers a [managed solution](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/monitoring) for monitoring your GenAI applications that integrates with MLflow Tracing.

Capabilities include:

- Track **operational metrics** like request volume, latency, errors, and cost.
- Monitor **quality metrics** such as correctness, safety, context sufficiency, and more using managed evaluation.
- Configure **custom metrics** with Python function.
- Root cause analysis by looking at the recorded **traces** from MLflow Tracing.
- Support for applications hosted outside of Databricks

## Production Monitoring Configurations

### Asynchronous Trace Logging

For production applications, MLflow logs traces asynchronously by default to prevent blocking your application:

| Environment Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Default Value |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING`         | Whether to log traces asynchronously. When set to `False`, traces will be logged in a blocking manner.                                                                                                                                                        | `True`        |
| `MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_WORKERS`    | The maximum number of worker threads to use for async trace logging per process. Increasing this allows higher throughput of trace logging, but also increases CPU usage and memory consumption.                                                              | `10`          |
| `MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` | The maximum number of traces that can be queued before being logged to backend by the worker threads. When the queue is full, new traces will be discarded. Increasing this allows higher durability of trace logging, but also increases memory consumption. | `1000`        |
| `MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_RETRY_TIMEOUT`  | The timeout in seconds for retrying failed trace logging. When a trace logging fails, it will be retried up to this timeout with backoff, after which it will be discarded.                                                                                   | `500`         |

Example configuration for high-volume applications:

```bash
export MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING=true
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_WORKERS=20
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=2000
export MLFLOW_ASYNC_TRACE_LOGGING_RETRY_TIMEOUT=600
```

### Sampling Traces

For a high-volume application, you may want to reduce the number of traces exported to the backend. You can configure the sampling ratio to control the number of traces exported.

| Environment Variable          | Description                                                                                                                   | Default Value |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `MLFLOW_TRACE_SAMPLING_RATIO` | The sampling ratio for traces. When set to `0.0`, no traces will be exported. When set to `1.0`, all traces will be exported. | `1.0`         |

The default value is `1.0`, which means all traces will be exported. When set to less than `1.0`, say `0.1`, only 10% of the traces will be exported. The sampling is done at the trace level, meaning that all spans in some traces will be exported or discarded together.

## Adding Context to Production Traces

In production environments, enriching traces with contextual information is crucial for understanding user behavior, debugging issues, and improving your GenAI application. This context enables you to analyze user interactions, track quality across different segments, and identify patterns that lead to better or worse outcomes.

### Tracking Request, Session, and User Context

Production applications need to track multiple pieces of context simultaneously. Here's a comprehensive example showing how to track all of these in a FastAPI application:

```python
import mlflow
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()


class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str


@app.post("/chat")  # FastAPI decorator should be outermost
@mlflow.trace  # Ensure @mlflow.trace is the inner decorator
def handle_chat(request: Request, chat_request: ChatRequest):
    # Retrieve all context from request headers
    client_request_id = request.headers.get("X-Request-ID")
    session_id = request.headers.get("X-Session-ID")
    user_id = request.headers.get("X-User-ID")

    # Update the current trace with all context and environment metadata
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        client_request_id=client_request_id,
        tags={
            # Session context - groups traces from multi-turn conversations
            "mlflow.trace.session": session_id,
            # User context - associates traces with specific users
            "mlflow.trace.user": user_id,
            # Environment metadata - tracks deployment context
            "environment": "production",
            "app_version": os.getenv("APP_VERSION", "1.0.0"),
            "deployment_id": os.getenv("DEPLOYMENT_ID", "unknown"),
            "region": os.getenv("REGION", "us-east-1"),
        },
    )

    # Your application logic for processing the chat message
    response_text = f"Processed message: '{chat_request.message}'"

    return {"response": response_text}
```

### Feedback Collection

Capturing user feedback on specific interactions is essential for understanding quality and improving your GenAI application:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.client import MlflowClient
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
from mlflow.entities import AssessmentSource

app = FastAPI()


class FeedbackRequest(BaseModel):
    is_correct: bool  # True for correct, False for incorrect
    comment: Optional[str] = None


@app.post("/chat_feedback")
def handle_chat_feedback(
    request: Request,
    client_request_id: str = Query(
        ..., description="The client request ID from the original chat request"
    ),
    feedback: FeedbackRequest = ...,
):
    """
    Collect user feedback for a specific chat interaction identified by client_request_id.
    """
    # Search for the trace with the matching client_request_id
    client = MlflowClient()
    experiment = client.get_experiment_by_name("production-genai-app")
    traces = client.search_traces(experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id])
    traces = [
        trace for trace in traces if trace.info.client_request_id == client_request_id
    ][:1]

    if not traces:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "message": f"Unable to find data for client request ID: {client_request_id}",
        }, 500

    # Log feedback using MLflow's log_feedback API
    mlflow.log_feedback(
        trace_id=traces[0].info.trace_id,
        name="response_is_correct",
        value=feedback.is_correct,
        source=AssessmentSource(
            source_type="HUMAN", source_id=request.headers.get("X-User-ID")
        ),
        rationale=feedback.comment,
    )

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Feedback recorded successfully",
        "trace_id": traces[0].info.trace_id,
    }
```

### Querying Traces with Context

Use the contextual information to analyze production behavior:

```python
import mlflow

# Query traces by user
user_traces = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
    filter_string="tags.`mlflow.trace.user` = 'user-jane-doe-12345'",
    max_results=100,
)

# Query traces by session
session_traces = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
    filter_string="tags.`mlflow.trace.session` = 'session-def-456'",
    max_results=100,
)

# Query traces by environment
production_traces = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
    filter_string="tags.environment = 'production'",
    max_results=100,
)
```
