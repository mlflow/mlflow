# Tracing Quickstart

This quickstart guide will walk you through setting up a simple GenAI application with MLflow Tracing. In less than 10 minutes, you'll enable tracing, run a basic application, and explore the generated traces in the MLflow UI.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires the following packages:

- **mlflow>=3.1**: Core MLflow functionality with GenAI features
- **openai>=1.0.0**: For OpenAI API integration

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "mlflow" openai>=1.0.0
```

:::note
Tracing features are available in MLflow 2.15.0+, though some advanced features may be limited compared to MLflow 3. It is **highly advised** to upgrade to MLflow 3 to get the benefits of tracing features that have been greatly improved.
:::

## Step 1: Set up your environment

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local MLflow" default>

For the fastest setup, you can run MLflow locally:

```bash
# Start MLflow tracking server locally
mlflow ui

# This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="remote" label="Remote MLflow Server">

If you have a remote MLflow tracking server, configure the connection:

```python
import os
import mlflow

# Set your MLflow tracking URI
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"] = "http://your-mlflow-server:5000"
# Or directly in code
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://your-mlflow-server:5000")
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="databricks" label="Databricks">

If you have a Databricks account, configure the connection:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.login()
```

This will prompt you for your configuration details (Databricks Host url and a PAT).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Configure OpenAI API Key

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```python
import os

# Set your OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"  # Replace with your actual API key
```

:::tip
You can also set the environment variable in your shell before running the script:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://your-mlflow-server:5000"  # Optional: for remote server, set as 'databricks' if connecting to a Databricks account
```

:::

## Step 2: Create a simple application with tracing

```python
import mlflow
import openai
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Set up MLflow experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("openai-tracing-quickstart")

# Enable automatic tracing for all OpenAI API calls
mlflow.openai.autolog()

client = OpenAI()


def get_weather_response(location):
    """Get a weather-related response for a given location."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful weather assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"What's the weather like in {location}?"},
        ],
        max_tokens=100,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


# Execute the traced function
location = "San Francisco"
response = get_weather_response(location)

print(f"Query: What's the weather like in {location}?")
print(f"Response: {response}")
print("\nTraces have been captured!")
print(
    "View them in the MLflow UI at: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or your MLflow server URL)"
)
```

## Step 3: Run the application

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="notebook" label="In a Jupyter Notebook" default>

Simply run the code cell above. You should see output similar to:

```
Query: What's the weather like in San Francisco?
Response: I don't have real-time weather data, but San Francisco typically has mild temperatures year-round...
Traces have been captured!
View them in the MLflow UI at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

:::tip
If you're using Jupyter with MLflow 2.20+, the trace UI will automatically display in your notebook when traces are generated!
:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="script" label="As a Python Script">

1. Save the code above to a file named `weather_app.py`
2. Run the script:

```bash
python weather_app.py
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Query: What's the weather like in San Francisco?
Response: I don't have real-time weather data, but San Francisco typically has mild temperatures year-round...
Traces have been captured!
View them in the MLflow UI at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Explore traces in the MLflow UI

1. **Open the MLflow UI** by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or your MLflow server URL)

2. **Click on the "openai-tracing-quickstart" experiment** from the experiments list

3. **Click on the "Traces" tab** to view all captured traces from your OpenAI API calls

4. **Click on any individual trace** to open the detailed trace view

5. **Explore the trace details** including input messages, system prompts, model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.), output responses, execution time, token usage, and the complete request/response flow

## Step 5: Add custom tracing (Optional)

Enhance your application with custom tracing for better observability:

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

mlflow.set_experiment("enhanced-weather-app")
mlflow.openai.autolog()

client = OpenAI()


@mlflow.trace
def preprocess_location(location):
    """Preprocess the location input."""
    # Add custom span for preprocessing
    cleaned_location = location.strip().title()
    return cleaned_location


@mlflow.trace
def get_enhanced_weather_response(location):
    """Enhanced weather response with preprocessing and custom metadata."""

    # Add tags for better organization
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "location": location,
            "app_version": "1.0.0",
            "request_type": "weather_query",
        }
    )

    # Preprocess input
    cleaned_location = preprocess_location(location)

    # Make OpenAI call (automatically traced)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful weather assistant."},
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"What's the weather like in {cleaned_location}?",
            },
        ],
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    result = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Add custom attributes
    mlflow.update_current_trace(
        tags={
            "response_length": len(result),
            "cleaned_location": cleaned_location,
        }
    )

    return result


# Test the enhanced function
locations = ["san francisco", "  New York  ", "tokyo"]

for location in locations:
    print(f"\n--- Processing: {location} ---")
    response = get_enhanced_weather_response(location)
    print(f"Response: {response[:100]}...")

print("\nEnhanced traces captured! Check the MLflow UI for detailed trace information.")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have basic tracing working, explore these advanced features:

1. **Search and Filter Traces**
   Learn how to find specific traces using the [search functionality](/genai/tracing/search-traces).

2. **Add Tags and Context**
   Organize your traces with [custom tags](/genai/tracing/attach-tags) for better monitoring.

3. **Production Deployment**
   Set up [production monitoring](/genai/tracing/prod-tracing) with the lightweight SDK.

4. **Integration with Other Libraries**
   Explore [automatic tracing](/genai/tracing/integrations/) for LangChain, LlamaIndex, and more.

5. **Manual Instrumentation**
   Learn [manual tracing techniques](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing) for custom applications.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Traces not appearing in UI:**

- Verify MLflow server is running and accessible
- Check that `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` is set correctly
- Ensure experiment exists (MLflow creates it automatically if it doesn't)

**OpenAI API errors:**

- Verify your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check that you have API credits available
- Ensure the model name (`gpt-4o-mini`) is correct and accessible

**MLflow server not starting:**

- Check if port 5000 is already in use: `lsof -i :5000`
- Try a different port: `mlflow ui --port 5001`
- Verify MLflow installation: `mlflow --version`

## Summary

Congratulations! You've successfully:
