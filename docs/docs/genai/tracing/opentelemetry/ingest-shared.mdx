:::info

OpenTelemetry trace ingestion is supported in **MLflow 3.6.0 and above**.

:::

## OpenTelemetry endpoint (OTLP)

MLflow Server exposes an OTLP endpoint at `/v1/traces` ([OTLP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/)). This endpoint accepts traces from any native OpenTelemetry instrumentation, allowing you to trace applications written in other languages such as Java, Go, Rust, etc.

To use this endpoint, start MLflow Server with a SQL-based backend store. The following command starts MLflow Server with an SQLite backend store:

```bash
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

To use other types of SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MSSQL, change the store URI as described in the [backend store documentation](/self-hosting/architecture/backend-store).

In your application, configure the server endpoint and set the MLflow experiment ID in the OTLP header `x-mlflow-experiment-id`.

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/v1/traces
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS=x-mlflow-experiment-id=123
```

:::note

Currently, MLflow Server supports only the OTLP/HTTP endpoint, and the OTLP/gRPC endpoint is not yet supported.
