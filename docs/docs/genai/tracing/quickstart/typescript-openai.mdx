# Tracing Quickstart (TS/JS)

:::info

The Python quickstart is available <ins>[here](/genai/tracing/quickstart/python-openai)</ins>.

:::

This quickstart guide will walk you through setting up a simple GenAI application with MLflow Tracing. In less than 10 minutes, you'll enable tracing, run a basic application, and explore the generated traces in the MLflow UI.

## Prerequisites

Install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
npm install mlflow-openai
```

:::info

The code example in this guide uses the OpenAI SDK; however, the contents of this guide are applicable to any other LLM providers, such as Anthropic, Google, Bedrock, and more.

For other LLM providers that are not natively integrated with auto-tracing, install the `mlflow-tracing` package and wrap the LLM call with the `mlflow.trace` wrapper function instead.

<details>
<summary>Example of wrapping Anthropic API calls to generate a trace</summary>

```typescript
import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

// Instantiate the Anthropic client
const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

// Define a traced function that wraps the Anthropic API call.
const generate = mlflow.trace(
    (prompt: string) => {
        return anthropic.messages.create({
            model: "claude-sonnet-4-latest",
            max_tokens: 1024,
            messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
        });
    },
    { spanType: mlflow.SpanType.LLM }
);

// Call the wrapped function as usual.
const response = await generate("Hello, Claude");
```

</details>

:::

## Step 1: Set up your environment

### Connect to MLflow

MLflow logs Traces in a tracking server. Connect your application to the tracking server by one of the following methods.

<ServerSetup />

### Create a new MLflow Experiment

Create a new MLflow experiment in the MLflow UI, or choose an existing experiment.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/mlflow-ui-new-experiment.png" alt="New Experiment" width="80%" />

1. Navigate to the MLflow UI in your browser. For example, if you started a local MLflow server at port 5000, you can navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
2. Click on the <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-sky-700 px-2 py-1.5 text-sm font-semibold text-white">Create</div> button on the top right.
3. Enter a name for the experiment and click on "Create".

_You can leave the `Artifact Location` field blank for now. It is an advanced configuration to override where MLflow stores experiment data._

### Initialize the Tracing SDK

<TabsWrapper>
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self Host" default>

    Call the `init` function with the tracking URI (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`) and the experiment ID. You can find the experiment ID by hovering over the <div className="inline-flex items-center justify-center w-5 h-5 rounded-full border border-gray-400 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-600">!</div> icon next to the experiment name within the MLflow UI.

    ```typescript
    import { init } from "mlflow-tracing";

    init({
        trackingUri: "<your-tracking-server-uri>",
        experimentId: "<your-experiment-id>",
    });
    ```

    If [authentication](/ml/auth) is enabled on the tracking server, you can pass the credential through `trackingServerUsername` and `trackingServerPassword`.

    ```typescript
    import { init } from "mlflow-tracing";

    init({
        trackingUri: "<your-tracking-server-uri>",
        experimentId: "<your-experiment-id>",
        trackingServerUsername: "<your-tracking-server-username>",
        trackingServerPassword: "<your-tracking-server-password>",
    });
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote MLflow Server">

    Call the `init` function with the URI of your remote MLflow server and the experiment ID. You can find the experiment ID by hovering over the <div className="inline-flex items-center justify-center w-5 h-5 rounded-full border border-gray-400 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-600">!</div> icon next to the experiment name within the MLflow UI.

    ```typescript
    import { init } from "mlflow-tracing";

    init({
        trackingUri: "<remote-tracking-server-uri>",
        experimentId: "<your-experiment-id>",
    });
    ```

    If [authentication](/ml/auth) is enabled on the tracking server, you can pass the credential through `trackingServerUsername` and `trackingServerPassword`.

    ```typescript
    import { init } from "mlflow-tracing";

    init({
        trackingUri: "<remote-tracking-server-uri>",
        experimentId: "<your-experiment-id>",
        trackingServerUsername: "<remote-tracking-server-username>",
        trackingServerPassword: "<remote-tracking-server-password>",
    });
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="databricks" label="Databricks">

    Call the `init` function with the URI of your remote MLflow server and the experiment ID. You can find the experiment ID by hovering over the <div className="inline-flex items-center justify-center w-5 h-5 rounded-full border border-gray-400 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-600">!</div> icon next to the experiment name within the MLflow UI.

    **Method 1: Use Databricks config file for authentication.**

    ```typescript
    import { init } from "mlflow-tracing";

    init({
        trackingUri: "databricks",
        experimentId: "<your-experiment-id>",
        // Optional: Set the Databricks config file path if it is not in the default location
        configPath: "<your-databricks-config-file-path>",
    });
    ```

    **Method 2: Use environment variables**

    ```bash
    export DATABRICKS_HOST=<your-databricks-host>
    export DATABRICKS_TOKEN=<your-databricks-personal-access-token>
    ```

    or create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

    ```bash
    DATABRICKS_HOST=<your-databricks-host>
    DATABRICKS_TOKEN=<your-databricks-personal-access-token>
    ```

    ```typescript
    // Load environment variables from .env file
    import 'dotenv/config';
    ```

    The `init` function will automatically load the above environment variables when tracking URI is set to `databricks`.

    ```typescript
    import { init } from "mlflow-tracing";

    init({
        trackingUri: "databricks",
        experimentId: "<your-experiment-id>",
    });
    ```

    </TabItem>

  </Tabs>
</TabsWrapper>

### Set OpenAI API Key (or other LLM providers)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  # Replace with your actual API key
```

## Step 2: Trace a single LLM call

Let's start with a simple example of tracing a single LLM call. We first wrap the OpenAI client with the `tracedOpenAI` function. After that, every call to OpenAI API will generate a trace span, capturing the input, output, latency, token counts, and other metadata.

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { tracedOpenAI } from "mlflow-openai";

// Wrap the OpenAI client with the tracedOpenAI function
const client = tracedOpenAI(new OpenAI());

// Invoke the client as usual
// If you are running this tutorial as a script, remove the `await` keyword.
await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    messages: [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful weather assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Seattle?"},
    ],
})
```

After running the code above, go to the MLflow UI and select the "Traces" tab. It should show the newly created trace.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/single-openai-trace-list.png" alt="Single Trace" />

The table view shows the primary metadata of the trace, such as the trace ID, execution duration, token count, source system and status. You can add or remove displayed columns by selecting the columns in the drop down.

By clicking on the request row (the linked request text), you can view the detailed spans in the trace.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/single-openai-trace-detail.png" alt="Single Trace Detail" width="80%" />

The "Chat" view in the above screenshot shows the full chat messages exchanged between the user and the model. By clicking other tables such as "Inputs / Outputs" or "Attributes", you can see different aspects of the trace, including the raw input payload, token usage breakdown, and more.

## Step 3: Trace a tool calling agent

Next, let's add a bit more complexity to the application. To get the real-time weather information, we will use an external weather API as a tool. The application will include a tool calling flow, not only a simple LLM call. To instrument that custom Python flow, we will use the `mlflow.trace` wrapper function.

```typescript
import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";

// Wrap the tool function with the `mlflow.trace` wrapper. The wrapped function will be automatically traced and logged to MLflow.
const getWeather = mlflow.trace(
    // A tool function that fetches the weather information from a weather API
    async function getWeather(latitude: number, longitude: number) {
        const response = await fetch(`https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=temperature_2m,wind_speed_10m&hourly=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m,wind_speed_10m`);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data['current']['temperature_2m'];
    },
     // Set the span type to TOOL. You can also set other span configuration here.
    { spanType: mlflow.SpanType.TOOL }
);
```

To pass the function as a tool to the LLM, we need to define the JSON schema for the function.

```typescript
const tools = [{
    type: "function",
    function: {
        name: "get_weather" as const,
        description: "Get current temperature for provided coordinates in celsius.",
        parameters: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
                latitude: { type: "number" },
                longitude: { type: "number" }
            },
            required: ["latitude", "longitude"],
            additionalProperties: false
        },
        strict: true
    }
}];
```

Lastly, define a simple flow that first asks the LLM to get instructions for calling the tool, then invokes the tool function, and lastly returns the result to the LLM.. This example uses the `mlflow.withSpan` API to create a parent span for the agent flow, but you can also achieve the same by using the `mlflow.trace` API like the previous example.

```typescript
async function runToolAgent(question: string) {
    console.log(`\n🤖 Running tool agent with question: "${question}"`);

    return await mlflow.withSpan(
        async () => {
            const client = tracedOpenAI(new OpenAI());
            const messages: any[] = [{"role": "user", "content": question}];

            // First LLM call to get tool instructions
            const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
                model: "o4-mini",
                messages: messages,
                tools: tools,
            });

            const aiMsg = response.choices[0].message;
            messages.push(aiMsg);

            // If the model requests tool call(s), invoke the function
            if (aiMsg.tool_calls && aiMsg.tool_calls.length > 0) {
                for (const toolCall of aiMsg.tool_calls) {
                    const functionName = toolCall.function.name;

                    if (functionName === "get_weather") {
                        // Invoke the tool function with the provided arguments
                        const args = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);
                        const toolResult = await getWeather(args.latitude, args.longitude);
                        messages.push({
                            "role": "tool",
                            "tool_call_id": toolCall.id,
                            "content": String(toolResult),
                        });
                    } else {
                        throw new Error(`Invalid tool returned: ${functionName}`);
                    }
                }

                // Second LLM call with tool results
                const finalResponse = await client.chat.completions.create({
                    model: "o4-mini",
                    messages: messages
                });
                return finalResponse.choices[0].message.content;
            }
            return aiMsg.content;
        },
        {
            name: "run_tool_agent",
            spanType: mlflow.SpanType.AGENT,
        }
    );
}

```

Now we can run the application.

```typescript
// If you are running this tutorial as a script, remove the `await` keyword.
await runToolAgent("What's the weather like in Seattle?")
```

## Step 4: Explore Traces in the UI

After running the application, you can explore the traces in the MLflow UI.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-tool-calling-trace-detail.png" alt="Tool Calling Trace" width="90%" />

The trace shows all LLM invocations and tool calls, organized in a tree structure. You can also inspect the timeline breakdown by clicking the timeline icon next to the tree view. This helps you understand where the time is spent in the application.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-tool-calling-trace-timeline.png" alt="Tool Calling Trace Timeline" width="90%" />

## Step 5: Attach Feedbacks on Traces

As a last step of this quickstart, let's attach feedback on the generated traces. In real world development, human feedback is critical to improve the quality of any LLM-powered application.

To add a feedback to a trace, you can open the trace detail page and click the "Add new Assessment" button on the top right. It will open an input form where you can provide various feedback values and metadata. For example, we can add feedback called "Quality" with an integer value (1~5), indicating how good the answer is. We can also put the detailed rationale behind the score for future reference.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-trace-feedback-input.png" alt="Feedback Input Form" width="90%" />

When you submit the form with "Create" button, the feedback will be attached to the trace.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-trace-feedback-record.png" alt="Feedback List" width="90%" />

The aggregated score in the experiment can be seen in the Trace list. You can do slice-and-dice by various criteria, such as timestamp, source, tags, and it will update the aggregated score in real-time.
