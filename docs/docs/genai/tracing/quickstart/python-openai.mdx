# Tracing Quickstart (Python)

:::info

The TypeScript/JavaScript quickstart is available <ins>[here](/genai/tracing/quickstart/typescript-openai)</ins>.

:::

This quickstart guide will walk you through setting up a simple GenAI application with MLflow Tracing. In less than 10 minutes, you'll enable tracing, run a basic application, and explore the generated traces in the MLflow UI.

## Prerequisites

Install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mlflow openai>=1.0.0
```

:::info

The code example in this guide uses the OpenAI SDK; however, the contents of this guide are applicable to any other LLM providers, such as Anthropic, Google, Bedrock, and more.

:::

## Step 1: Set up your environment

### Connect to MLflow

MLflow logs Traces in a tracking server. Connect your local environment to the tracking server by one of the following methods.

<ServerSetup />

### Create a new MLflow Experiment

```python
import mlflow

# This will create a new experiment called "Tracing Quickstart" and set it as active
mlflow.set_experiment("Tracing Quickstart")
```

### Configure OpenAI API Key (or other LLM providers)

```python
import os

# Use different env variable when using a different LLM provider
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"  # Replace with your actual API key
```

## Step 2: Trace a single LLM call

Let's start with a simple example of tracing a single LLM call. We first enable automatic tracing for OpenAI API calls by calling `mlflow.openai.autolog()`. After that, every call to OpenAI API will generate a trace span, capturing the input, output, latency, token counts, and other metadata.

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

# Enable automatic tracing for all OpenAI API calls
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Instantiate the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

# Invoke chat completion API
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful weather assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Seattle?"},
    ],
)
```

After running the code above, go to the MLflow UI and select the "Traces" tab. It should show the newly created trace.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/single-openai-trace-list.png" alt="Single Trace" />

The table view shows the primary metadata of the trace, such as the trace ID, execution duration, token count, source system and status. You can add or remove displayed columns by selecting the columns in the drop down. By clicking on the request row (the linked request text), you can view the detailed spans in the trace.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/single-openai-trace-detail.png" alt="Single Trace Detail" width="80%" />

The "Chat" view in the above screenshot shows the full chat messages exchanged between the user and the model. By clicking other tables such as "Inputs / Outputs" or "Attributes", you can see different aspects of the trace, including the raw input payload, token usage breakdown, and more.

## Step 3: Trace a tool calling agent

Next, let's add a bit more complexity to the application. To get the real-time weather information, we will use an external weather API as a tool. The application will include a tool calling flow, not only a simple LLM call. To instrument that custom Python flow, we will use the <APILink fn="mlflow.trace">`@mlflow.trace`</APILink> decorator. Use of this simple decorator generates a span for the function call and automatically captures the function inputs, outputs, latency, and exceptions.

Let's define a Python function that fetches the weather information from a weather API.

```python
import requests
from mlflow.entities import SpanType


# Decorated with @mlflow.trace to trace the function call.
@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.TOOL)
def get_weather(latitude, longitude):
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&current=temperature_2m,wind_speed_10m&hourly=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m,wind_speed_10m"
    )
    data = response.json()
    return data["current"]["temperature_2m"]
```

To pass the function as a tool to the LLM, we need to define the JSON schema for the function.

```python
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get current temperature for provided coordinates in celsius.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "latitude": {"type": "number"},
                    "longitude": {"type": "number"},
                },
                "required": ["latitude", "longitude"],
                "additionalProperties": False,
            },
            "strict": True,
        },
    }
]
```

Lastly, define a simple flow that first asks the LLM to get instructions for calling the tool, then invokes the tool function, and lastly returns the result to the LLM.

```python
import json
from mlflow.entities import SpanType


# Define a simple tool calling agent
@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.AGENT)
def run_tool_agent(question: str):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": question}]

    # Invoke the model with the given question and available tools
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="o4-mini",
        messages=messages,
        tools=tools,
    )
    ai_msg = response.choices[0].message
    messages.append(ai_msg)

    # If the model requests tool call(s), invoke the function with the specified arguments
    if tool_calls := ai_msg.tool_calls:
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            function_name = tool_call.function.name
            if function_name == "get_weather":
                # Invoke the tool function with the provided arguments
                args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
                tool_result = get_weather(**args)
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("An invalid tool is returned from the assistant!")

            messages.append(
                {
                    "role": "tool",
                    "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                    "content": str(tool_result),
                }
            )

        # Sent the tool results to the model and get a new response
        response = client.chat.completions.create(model="o4-mini", messages=messages)

    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

Now we can run the application.

```python
# Run the tool calling agent
question = "What's the weather like in Seattle?"
answer = run_tool_agent(question)
```

## Step 4: Explore Traces in the UI

After running the application, you can explore the traces in the MLflow UI.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-tool-calling-trace-detail.png" alt="Tool Calling Trace" width="90%" />

The trace shows all LLM invocations and tool calls, organized in a tree structure. You can also inspect the timeline breakdown by clicking the timeline icon next to the tree view. This helps you understand where the time is spent in the application.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-tool-calling-trace-timeline.png" alt="Tool Calling Trace Timeline" width="90%" />

## Step 5: Attach Feedbacks on Traces

As a last step of this quickstart, let's attach feedback on the generated traces. In real world development, human feedback is critical to improve the quality of any LLM-powered application.

To add a feedback to a trace, you can open the trace detail page and click the "Add new Assessment" button on the top right. It will open an input form where you can provide various feedback values and metadata. For example, we can add feedback called "Quality" with an integer value (1~5), indicating how good the answer is. We can also put the detailed rationale behind the score for future reference.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-trace-feedback-input.png" alt="Feedback Input Form" width="90%" />

When you submit the form with "Create" button, the feedback will be attached to the trace.

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/quickstart/openai-trace-feedback-record.png" alt="Feedback List" width="90%" />

The aggregated score in the experiment can be seen in the Trace list. You can do slice-and-dice by various criteria, such as timestamp, source, tags, and it will update the aggregated score in real-time.
