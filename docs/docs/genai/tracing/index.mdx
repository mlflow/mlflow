## Monitor Performance and Optimize Costs

Understanding and optimizing the performance of your GenAI applications is crucial for maintaining efficient operations. MLflow Tracing enables you to capture and monitor key operational metrics such as **latency and execution timing** at each step of your application's execution.

This comprehensive monitoring capability allows you to track and identify performance bottlenecks within complex pipelines, monitor execution efficiency to ensure optimal operation, and identify areas for performance improvement in your code or model interactions. By understanding where time is spent in your application flow, you can make informed decisions about optimization strategies.

## Evaluate and Enhance Application Quality

Systematically assessing and improving the quality of your GenAI applications is a core challenge. MLflow Tracing helps by allowing you to **attach and track [user feedback](/genai/tracing/collect-user-feedback) and the results of [quality evaluations](/genai/eval-monitor)** (from LLM judges or custom metrics) directly to your traces.

This enables comprehensive quality assessment throughout your application's lifecycle:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="development" label="During Development" default>
    Evaluate traces using human reviewers or LLM judges to measure accuracy, relevance, and other quality aspects. Track quality improvements as you iterate on prompts, models, or retrieval strategies while identifying patterns in quality issues (e.g., specific types of queries that lead to poor responses). This data-driven approach enables you to make systematic improvements to your application.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="production" label="In Production">
    Monitor and assess quality in real-time by tracking quality metrics (derived from user feedback and evaluation results) across deployments. Identify sudden quality degradation or regressions, trigger alerts for critical quality issues, and help maintain quality Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Traces from both evaluation runs and production monitoring can be explored to identify root causes of quality issues‚Äîfor instance, insufficiently retrieved documents in a RAG system or degraded performance of a specific model. Traces empower you to analyze these issues in detail and iterate quickly.

Moreover, traces are invaluable for **building high-quality evaluation datasets**. By capturing real user interactions and their outcomes, you can curate representative test cases based on actual usage patterns, build comprehensive evaluation sets that cover diverse scenarios, and use this data to fine-tune models or improve retrieval mechanisms.

When combined with [MLflow GenAI Evaluation](/genai/eval-monitor), MLflow offers a seamless experience for assessing and improving your application's quality.


## Industry-Standard Observability with OpenTelemetry

MLflow Tracing is built on **OpenTelemetry**, the industry-standard open source specification for observability. This foundation ensures that your tracing implementation follows widely accepted standards and provides interoperability with the broader observability ecosystem.

The OpenTelemetry compatibility means you can export your MLflow trace data to various monitoring and observability services in your existing infrastructure stack, including Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, and other OpenTelemetry-compatible systems. This standardization gives you the flexibility to integrate MLflow Tracing into your current monitoring workflows without vendor lock-in.

By conforming to OpenTelemetry standards, MLflow Tracing ensures that your observability investment is portable and future-proof, allowing you to leverage the growing ecosystem of OpenTelemetry-compatible tools and services. See [Export Traces to Other Services](/genai/tracing/prod-tracing#opentelemetry-integration) for detailed integration instructions.

This broad support means you can gain observability without significant code changes, leveraging the tools you already use. For custom components or unsupported libraries, MLflow also provides powerful [manual tracing APIs](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing).

## Manual Tracing

In addition to the one-line auto tracing experience, MLflow offers Python SDK for manually instrumenting your code and manipulating traces:

- [Instrument a function with `@mlflow.trace` decorator](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing/fluent-apis#decorator)
- [Instrument any block of code using `mlflow.start_span` context manager](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing/fluent-apis#context-manager)
- [Group or annotate traces using tags](/genai/tracing/attach-tags)
- [Disable tracing globally](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic#disabling-tracing)

Refer to the [Manual Tracing Guide](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing) for complete details about the SDK.

## Reviewing and Querying Traces

MLflow Traces can be reviewed and analyzed in several ways:

**MLflow UI**: The MLflow UI provides a rich interface for exploring traces. You can view traces for a specific experiment, run, and [search and filter traces](/genai/tracing/search-traces) based on various criteria. Start the UI by running `mlflow ui` in your terminal and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

**Jupyter Notebook**: The trace UI is also available within Jupyter notebooks! The trace UI will automatically be displayed when a cell generates a trace, eliminating the need to switch between the notebook and web browser.

**Programmatic Access**: Query and analyze traces with Python APIs to search traces with filters and conditions using <APILink fn="mlflow.search_traces" />, retrieve specific traces for detailed analysis, export data for custom analysis or integration with other tools, and build custom dashboards and monitoring solutions.

Trace data is useful for various downstream tasks, such as creating evaluation datasets for offline evaluation and production monitoring. MLflow provides several APIs to search and retrieve recorded traces programmatically. See [Searching and Retrieving Traces](/genai/tracing/search-traces) for more details.
