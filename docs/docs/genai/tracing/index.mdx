## One-line Auto Tracing Integrations

MLflow Tracing is integrated with various GenAI libraries and provides one-line automatic tracing experience for each library (and combinations of them!):

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.openai.autolog()  # or replace 'openai' with other library names, e.g., "anthropic"
```

Click on the logos below to learn more about the individual integration:

<TracingIntegrations cardGroupProps={{ cols: 6, noGap: true }} />
<br />

## Flexible and Customizable

In addition to the one-line auto tracing experience, MLflow offers Python SDK for manually instrumenting your code and manipulating traces:

- [Trace a function with `@mlflow.trace` decorator](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing#decorator)
- [Trace any block of code using context manager](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing#context-manager)
- [Combine multiple auto-tracing integrations](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic/#multi-framework-example)
- [Instrument multi-threaded applications](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing#multi-threading)
- [Native async support](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing#async-support)
- [Group and filter traces using sessions](/genai/tracing/track-users-sessions)
- [Redact PII data from traces](/genai/tracing/observe-with-traces/masking)
- [Disable tracing globally](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic#disabling-tracing)
- [Configure sampling ratio to control trace throughput](/genai/tracing/prod-tracing#sampling-traces)

## Production Readiness

MLflow Tracing is production ready and provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for your GenAI applications in production environments. By enabling [async logging](/genai/tracing/prod-tracing/#asynchronous-trace-logging), trace logging is done in the background and does not impact the performance of your application.

For production deployments, it is recommended to use the [Lightweight Tracing SDK](/genai/tracing/lightweight-sdk) (`mlflow-tracing`) that is optimized for reducing the total installation size and minimizing dependencies while maintaining full tracing capabilities. Compared to the full `mlflow` package, the `mlflow-tracing` package requires 95% smaller footprint.

Read [Production Monitoring](/genai/tracing/prod-tracing) for complete guidance on using MLflow Tracing for monitoring models in production and various backend configuration options.
