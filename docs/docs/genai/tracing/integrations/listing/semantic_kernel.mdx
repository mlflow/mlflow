# Tracing Semantic Kernel

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/semantic-kernel-tracing.png" alt="Semantic Kernel Tracing via autolog" />

[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) is a lightweight, open-source SDK that functions as AI middleware, enabling you to integrate AI models into your C#, Python, or Java codebase via a uniform API layer. By abstracting model interactions, it lets you swap in new models without rewriting your application logic.

[MLflow Tracing](/genai/tracing) provides automatic tracing capability for Semantic Kernel. By enabling auto tracing for Semantic Kernel via the <APILink fn="mlflow.semantic_kernel.autolog" /> function, MLflow will capture traces for LLM invocations and log them to the active MLflow Experiment.

MLflow trace automatically captures the following information about Semantic Kernel calls:

- Prompts and completion responses
- Chat history and messages
- Latencies
- Model name and provider
- Kernel functions and plugins
- Template variables and arguments
- Token usage information
- Any exceptions if raised

Currently, tracing for streaming is not supported. If you want this feature, please file a [feature request](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues).

## Getting Started

To get started, let's install the requisite libraries. Note that we will use OpenAI for demonstration purposes, but this tutorial extends to all providers supported by Semantic Kernel.

```bash
pip install 'mlflow>=3.2.0' semantic_kernel openai
```

Then, enable autologging in your Python code:

:::important
You must run `mlflow.semantic_kernel.autolog()` prior to running Semantic Kernel code. If this is not performed, traces may not be logged properly.
:::

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.semantic_kernel.autolog()
```

Finally, for setup, let's establish our OpenAI token:

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("openai_api_key: ")
```

## Example Usage

:::note
Semantic Kernel primarily uses asynchronous programming patterns. The examples below use `async`/`await` syntax. If you're running these in a Jupyter notebook, the code will work as-is. For scripts, you'll need to wrap the async calls appropriately (e.g., using `asyncio.run()`).
:::

The simplest example to show the tracing integration is to instrument a [ChatCompletion Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/ai-services/chat-completion/?tabs=csharp-AzureOpenAI%2Cpython-AzureOpenAI%2Cjava-AzureOpenAI&pivots=programming-language-python).

```python
import openai
from semantic_kernel import Kernel
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import OpenAIChatCompletion
from semantic_kernel.functions.function_result import FunctionResult

# Create a basic OpenAI client
openai_client = openai.AsyncOpenAI()

# Create a Semantic Kernel instance and register the OpenAI chat completion service
kernel = Kernel()
kernel.add_service(
    OpenAIChatCompletion(
        service_id="chat-gpt",
        ai_model_id="gpt-4o-mini",
        async_client=openai_client,
    )
)

answer = await kernel.invoke_prompt("Is sushi the best food ever?")
print("AI says:", answer)
```

## Token Usage Tracking

MLflow >= 3.2.0 supports token usage tracking for Semantic Kernel. The token usage for each LLM call during a kernel invocation will be logged in the `mlflow.chat.tokenUsage` span attribute, and the total usage in the entire trace will be logged in the `mlflow.trace.tokenUsage` metadata field.

```python
# Generate a trace using the above example
# ...


# Get the trace object just created
last_trace_id = mlflow.get_last_active_trace_id()
trace = mlflow.get_trace(trace_id=last_trace_id)

# Print the token usage
total_usage = trace.info.token_usage
print("== Total token usage: ==")
print(f"  Input tokens: {total_usage['input_tokens']}")
print(f"  Output tokens: {total_usage['output_tokens']}")
print(f"  Total tokens: {total_usage['total_tokens']}")
```

```
== Total token usage: ==
  Input tokens: 14
  Output tokens: 113
  Total tokens: 127
```

## Disable Auto-tracing

Auto tracing for Semantic Kernel can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.semantic_kernel.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
