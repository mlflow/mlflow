# Tracing CrewAI

![CrewAI Tracing via autolog](/images/llms/crewai/crewai-tracing.gif)

[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is an open-source framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agent.

[MLflow Tracing](../../) provides automatic tracing capability for [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), an open source framework for building multi-agent applications. By enabling auto tracing
for CrewAI by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.crewai.autolog" /> function, , MLflow will capture nested traces for CrewAI workflow execution and logged them to the active MLflow Experiment.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.crewai.autolog()
```

MLflow trace automatically captures the following information about CrewAI agents:

- Tasks and Agent who executes each task
- Every LLM calls with input prompts, completion responses, and various metadata
- Memory load and writes operations
- Latency of each operation
- Any exception if raised

:::note

Currently, MLflow CrewAI integration only support tracing for synchronous task execution. Asynchronous task and kickoff are not supported right now.

:::

### Example Usage

First, enable auto-tracing for CrewAI, and optionally create an MLflow experiment to write traces to. This helps organizing your traces better.

```python
import mlflow

# Turn on auto tracing by calling mlflow.crewai.autolog()
mlflow.crewai.autolog()


# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("CrewAI")
```

Next, define a multi-agent workflow using CrewAI. The following example defines a trip planner agent that uses web search capability as a tool.

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool

from textwrap import dedent

content = "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."
string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content=content, metadata={"preference": "personal"}
)

search_tool = WebsiteSearchTool()


class TripAgents:
    def city_selection_agent(self):
        return Agent(
            role="City Selection Expert",
            goal="Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices",
            backstory="An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations",
            tools=[
                search_tool,
            ],
            verbose=True,
        )

    def local_expert(self):
        return Agent(
            role="Local Expert at this city",
            goal="Provide the BEST insights about the selected city",
            backstory="""A knowledgeable local guide with extensive information
        about the city, it's attractions and customs""",
            tools=[search_tool],
            verbose=True,
        )


class TripTasks:
    def identify_task(self, agent, origin, cities, interests, range):
        return Task(

                multiple cities, considering factors like current weather

### Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for CrewAI can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.crewai.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
