# Tracing Strands Agents SDK

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/strands/strands-tracing.png" alt="Agno Tracing via autolog" />

[Strands Agents SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) is an open‑source, model‑driven SDK developed by AWS that enables developers to create autonomous AI agents
simply by defining a model, a set of tools, and a prompt in just a few lines of code.

[MLflow Tracing](../../) provides automatic tracing capability for Strands Agents SDK. By enabling auto tracing
for Strands Agents SDK by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.strands.autolog" /> function, MLflow will capture traces for Agent invocation and log them to the active MLflow Experiment.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.strands.autolog()
```

MLflow trace automatically captures the following information about Agentic calls:

- Prompts and completion responses
- Latencies
- Metadata about the different Agents, such as function names
- Token usages and cost
- Cache hit
- Any exception if raised

### Basic Example

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.strands.autolog()
mlflow.set_experiment("Strand Agent")

from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={"api_key": "<api-key>"},
    # **model_config
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 2000,
        "temperature": 0.7,
    },
)

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What is 2+2")
print(response)
```

## Token Usage and Cost

MLflow automatically tracks token usage and cost for Strands Agent SDK. See the [Token Usage and Cost Tracking](/genai/tracing/token-usage-cost) documentation for details on accessing this information programmatically.

### Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for Strands Agent SDK can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.strands.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
