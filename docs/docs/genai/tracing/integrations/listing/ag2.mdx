# Tracing AG2ðŸ¤–

![AG2 Tracing via autolog](/images/llms/ag2/ag2-trace.png)

[AG2](https://ag2.ai/) is an open-source framework for building and orchestrating AI agent interactions.

[MLflow Tracing](../) provides automatic tracing capability for AG2, an open-source multi-agent framework. By enabling auto tracing
for AG2 by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.ag2.autolog" /> function, MLflow will capture nested traces and logged them to the active MLflow Experiment upon agents execution.
Note that since AG2 is built based on [AutoGen 0.2](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/), this integration can be used when you use AutoGen 0.2.


```python
import mlflow

mlflow.ag2.autolog()
```

MLflow captures the following information about the multi-agent execution:

* Which agent is called at different turns
* Messages passed between agents
* LLM and tool calls made by each agent, organized per an agent and a turn
* Latencies
* Any exception if raised

### Basic Example

```python
import os
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from autogen import ConversableAgent

import mlflow

# Turn on auto tracing for AG2
mlflow.ag2.autolog()

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("AG2")


# Define a simple multi-agent workflow using AG2
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        # Please set your OpenAI API Key to the OPENAI_API_KEY env var before running this example
        "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    }
]

Operator = Literal["+", "-", "*", "/"]


def calculator(a: int, b: int, operator: Annotated[Operator, "operator"]) -> int:
    if operator == "+":
        return a + b
    elif operator == "-":
        return a - b
    elif operator == "*":
        return a * b
    elif operator == "/":
        return int(a / b)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operator")


# First define the assistant agent that suggests tool calls.
assistant = ConversableAgent(
    name="Assistant",
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant. "
    "You can help with simple calculations. "
    "Return 'TERMINATE' when the task is done.",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)

# The user proxy agent is used for interacting with the assistant agent
# and executes tool calls.
user_proxy = ConversableAgent(
    name="Tool Agent",
    llm_config=False,
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: msg.get("content") is not None
    and "TERMINATE" in msg["content"],
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

# Register the tool signature with the assistant agent.
assistant.register_for_llm(name="calculator", description="A simple calculator")(
    calculator
)
user_proxy.register_for_execution(name="calculator")(calculator)
response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant, message="What is (44231 + 13312 / (230 - 20)) * 4?"
)
```

### Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for AG2 can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.ag2.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
