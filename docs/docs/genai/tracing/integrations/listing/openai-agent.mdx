# Tracing OpenAI Agent🤖

![OpenAI Tracing via autolog](/images/llms/tracing/openai-agent-tracing.png)

[MLflow Tracing](/genai/tracing) provides automatic tracing capability for [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents-sdk), a multi-agent framework developed by OpenAI. By enabling auto tracing
for OpenAI by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.openai.autolog" /> function, MLflow will capture traces and log them to the active MLflow Experiment.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.openai.autolog()
```

## Basic Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Agents SDK with MLflow tracing for simple multi-language chat agents. The three agents collaborate to determine the language of the input and handoff to the appropriate sub-agent that speaks the language. MLflow captures how the agents interact with each other and make calls to the OpenAI API.

```python
import mlflow
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Enable auto tracing for OpenAI Agents SDK
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("OpenAI Agent")

# Define a simple multi-agent workflow
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English agent",
    instructions="You only speak English",
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage agent",
    instructions="Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
)


async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
    print(result.final_output)


# If you are running this code in a Jupyter notebook, replace this with `await main()`.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Function Calling

OpenAI Agents SDK support defining functions that can be called by the agent. MLflow captures the function calls and display what functions are available to the agent, which of them are called, and the inputs and outputs of the function calls.

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

# Enable auto tracing for OpenAI Agents SDK
mlflow.openai.autolog()


@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."


agent = Agent(
    name="Hello world",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)


async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input="What's the weather in Tokyo?")
    print(result.final_output)
    # The weather in Tokyo is sunny.


# If you are running this code in a Jupyter notebook, replace this with `await main()`.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Guardrails

OpenAI Agents SDK support defining guardrails that can be used to check the input and output of the agent. MLflow captures the guardrail checks and display the reasoning behind the guardrail check and whether the guardrail was tripped.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agents import (
    Agent,
    GuardrailFunctionOutput,
    InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    RunContextWrapper,
    Runner,
    TResponseInputItem,
    input_guardrail,
)

# Enable auto tracing for OpenAI Agents SDK
mlflow.openai.autolog()


class MathHomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_math_homework: bool
    reasoning: str


guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the user is asking you to do their math homework.",
    output_type=MathHomeworkOutput,
)


@input_guardrail
async def math_guardrail(
    ctx: RunContextWrapper[None], agent: Agent, input
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input, context=ctx.context)

    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=result.final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=result.final_output.is_math_homework,
    )


agent = Agent(
    name="Customer support agent",
    instructions="You are a customer support agent. You help customers with their questions.",
    input_guardrails=[math_guardrail],
)


async def main():
    # This should trip the guardrail
    try:
        await Runner.run(agent, "Hello, can you help me solve for x: 2x + 3 = 11?")
        print("Guardrail didn't trip - this is unexpected")

    except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:
        print("Math homework guardrail tripped")


# If you are running this code in a Jupyter notebook, replace this with `await main()`.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for OpenAI Agents SDK can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.openai.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
