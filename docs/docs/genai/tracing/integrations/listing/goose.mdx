# Tracing Goose

<ImageBox src="/images/llms/tracing/goose-tracing.png" alt="Goose Tracing via MLflow" />

[MLflow Tracing](/genai/tracing) provides automatic tracing capability for [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose), an open-source AI agent by Block that automates engineering tasks on your local machine. MLflow supports tracing for Goose through the [OpenTelemetry](/genai/tracing/opentelemetry) integration.

:::tip What is Goose?
[Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) is an open-source, on-device AI agent built by Block. It goes beyond code suggestions — Goose can autonomously write and execute code, manage files, run shell commands, interact with APIs, browse the web, and orchestrate pipelines. It works with any LLM provider and is extensible through [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers.
:::

## Step 1: Install Goose

Install the Goose CLI using the official installer:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | CONFIGURE=false bash

# Or install via Homebrew
brew install block/tap/goose
```

For other installation methods, see the [Goose documentation](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Step 2: Start the MLflow Tracking Server

Start the MLflow Tracking Server with a SQL-based backend store:

```bash
mlflow server --port 5000
```

This example uses SQLite as the backend store. To use other types of SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MSSQL, change the store URI as described in the [backend store documentation](/self-hosting/architecture/backend-store).

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Goose has a built-in OpenTelemetry exporter that sends traces over OTLP/HTTP. Point it at the MLflow server:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-mlflow-experiment-id=0
```

:::note About `x-mlflow-experiment-id`
The `x-mlflow-experiment-id` header tells MLflow which experiment to associate the traces with. You can use `0` for the default experiment, or specify a custom experiment ID. To create a new experiment and get its ID, run:

```bash
mlflow experiments create --experiment-name "goose-traces"
```

:::

To export only traces (and disable metrics/logs export), you can optionally set:

```bash
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none
```

## Step 4: Run Goose

With the environment variables set in the same shell session, start Goose:

```bash
goose session
```

Or run a one-off task:

```bash
goose run -t "What is 2 + 2?"
```

Goose will automatically export traces to MLflow. All interactions — including LLM calls, tool executions, and agent decisions — are traced automatically.

## Step 5: View Traces in MLflow

After running a Goose session, open the MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000` and navigate to the Traces tab.

You will see detailed traces showing:

- **LLM Requests**: Full prompts and completions with token usage
- **Tool Executions**: Shell commands, file operations, and other tool calls
- **Agent Decisions**: The agent's reasoning and planning steps

## Troubleshooting

### Traces Not Appearing in MLflow

1. **Check backend store**: Ensure MLflow is using a SQL backend, not file-based storage
2. **Verify endpoint**: Confirm the MLflow server is running and accessible at the configured endpoint
3. **Check OTel is enabled**: Run `echo $OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to verify the environment variable is set in the same shell session where Goose is running
4. **Check OTel is not disabled**: Ensure `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` is not set to `true`
5. **Try console export**: Set `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console` to verify Goose is generating traces
