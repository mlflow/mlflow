# Tracing Mistral

![Mistral tracing via autolog](/images/llms/mistral/mistral-tracing.png)

MLflow Tracing ensures observability for your interactions with Mistral AI models.
When Mistral auto-tracing is enabled by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.mistral.autolog" /> function,
usage of the Mistral SDK will automatically record generated traces during interactive development.

Note that only synchronous calls to the Text Generation API are supported,
and that asynchronous API and streaming methods are not traced.

### Example Usage

```python
import os

from mistralai import Mistral

import mlflow

# Turn on auto tracing for Mistral AI by calling mlflow.mistral.autolog()
mlflow.mistral.autolog()

# Configure your API key.
client = Mistral(api_key=os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"])

# Use the chat complete method to create new chat.
chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model="mistral-small-latest",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Who is the best French painter? Answer in one short sentence.",
        },
    ],
)
print(chat_response.choices[0].message)
```

## Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for Mistral can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.mistral.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
