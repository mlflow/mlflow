# MLflow Typescript SDK for Tracing

:::info Waiting for your feedback

MLflow Typescript SDK is an experimental package. We are actively working on it and would love to hear your feedback. Please raise a feature request or bug reports in <ins>[GitHub](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/new/choose)</ins>.

:::

MLflow's Typescript SDK empowers AI application developers by bringing [MLflow's Tracing](/genai/tracing) capabilities to Typescript and Javascript. With minimum code changes, you can **debug**, **evaluate**, and **monitor** your applications with MLflow's powerful observability features and take advantage of the trusted end-to-end MLOps platform.

## Quick Start

If you are new to MLflow Tracing, please start with the following quickstart guide:

<TilesGrid>
  <TileCard
    image="/images/logos/javascript-typescript-logo.png"
    title="Quickstart (JS/TS)"
    description="Get started with MLflow in JavaScript or TypeScript"
    href="/genai/tracing/quickstart/typescript-openai"
    linkText="Start building â†’"
    containerHeight={64}
  />
</TilesGrid>

## Installation

```bash
npm install mlflow-tracing
```

After installation, connect your application to an MLflow server by following the [Connecting to an MLflow Server](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation#2-connect-your-application-with-mlflow) guide.

## Basic Usage

<TabsWrapper>
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Simple Function">

```typescript
// Wrap a function with mlflow.trace to generate a span when the function is called.
const getWeather = mlflow.trace(
  (city: string) => {
    return `The weather in ${city} is sunny`;
  },
  // Pass options to set span name.
  { name: 'get-weather' }
);

// Invoke the function as usual, MLflow will automatically create a span and capture
// inputs, outputs, latency, and exception information.
getWeather('San Francisco');

// Alternatively, start and end spans manually.
const span = mlflow.startSpan({ name: 'my-span', inputs: { message: 'Hi, MLflow!' } });
span.end({ outputs: { message: 'Hi, what can I do for you?' } });
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="OpenAI">

Install the OpenAI integration package:

```bash
npm install mlflow-openai
```

Then, wrap the OpenAI client with the `tracedOpenAI` function:

```typescript
import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";

// Initialize the tracing SDK
mlflow.init({
    trackingUri: "<your-tracking-server-uri>",
    experimentId: "<your-experiment-id>",
});

import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { tracedOpenAI } from "mlflow-openai";

// Wrap the OpenAI client with the tracedOpenAI function
const client = tracedOpenAI(new OpenAI());

// Invoke the client as usual
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    messages: [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful weather assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Seattle?"},
    ],
})
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabsWrapper>

## Automatic Tracing

MLflow Tracing Typescript SDK currently supports automatic tracing for the following libraries:

<CardGroup isSmall>
  <SmallLogoCard link="/genai/tracing/integrations/listing/openai">
    <span>![OpenAI Logo](/images/logos/openai-logo.png)</span>
  </SmallLogoCard>
</CardGroup>

## Manual Tracing

### Tracing a function with the `trace` API

The `trace` API is useful when you want to trace a function.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="function" label="Named Function">

    ```typescript
    import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";

    const getWeather = async (city: string) => {
        return `The weather in ${city} is sunny`;
    };

    // Wrap the function with mlflow.trace to create a traced function.
    const tracedGetWeather = mlflow.trace(
        getWeather,
        { name: 'get-weather' }
    );

    // Invoke the traced function as usual.
    await tracedGetWeather('San Francisco');
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="anonymous-function" label="Anonymous Function">

    ```typescript
    import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";

    const getWeather = mlflow.trace(
        (city: string) => {
            return `The weather in ${city} is sunny`;
        },
        // When wrapping an anonymous function, you need to specify the span name.
        { name: 'get-weather' }
    );

    // Invoke the traced function as usual.
    getWeather('San Francisco');
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

On the invocation of the traced function, MLflow will automatically create a span that captures:

- Input arguments
- Return value
- Exception information if thrown
- Latency

### Capturing Nested Function Calls

If you trace nested functions, MLflow will generate a trace with multiple spans, where the span structure captures the nested function calls.

```typescript
const sum = mlflow.trace(
    (a: number, b: number) => {
        return a + b;
    },
    { name: 'sum' }
);

const multiply = mlflow.trace(
    (a: number, b: number) => {
        return a * b;
    },
    { name: 'multiply' }
);

const computeArea = mlflow.trace(
    (a: number, b: number, h: number) => {
        const sumOfBase = sum(a, b);
        const area = multiply(sumOfBase, h);
        return multiply(area, 0.5);
    },
    { name: 'compute-area' }
);

computeArea(1, 2, 3);
```

The trace will look like this:

```
- compute-area
  - sum (a=1, b=2)
  - multiply (a=3, b=3)
  - multiply (a=9, b=0.5)
```

### Tracing a class method with the `@trace` API

TypeScript version 5.0+ supports decorators. MLflow Tracing supports this syntax to trace class methods easily. MLflow will automatically create a span that captures:

- Input arguments
- Return value
- Exception information if thrown
- Latency

```typescript
import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";

class MyClass {
    @mlflow.trace({ spanType: mlflow.SpanType.LLM })
    generateText(prompt: string) {
        return "It's sunny in Seattle!";
    }
}

const myClass = new MyClass();
myClass.generateText("What's the weather like in Seattle?");
```

### Tracing a block of code with the `withSpan` API

The `withSpan` API is useful when you want to trace a block of code, not a function.

```typescript
import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";

const question = "What's the weather like in Seattle?";

const result = await mlflow.withSpan(
    async (span: mlflow.Span) => {
        return "It's sunny in Seattle!";
    },
    // Pass name, span type, and inputs as options.
    {
        name: "generateText",
        spanType: mlflow.SpanType.TOOL,
        inputs: { prompt: question },
    }
);
```

### Create and End a Span Explicitly

To get more control over the span lifecycle, you can create and end a span explicitly.

```typescript
import * as mlflow from "mlflow-tracing";

const span = mlflow.startSpan({
    name: "generateText",
    spanType: mlflow.SpanType.LLM,
    inputs: { prompt: question },
});

span.end({
    outputs: { answer: "It's sunny in Seattle!" },
    status: 'OK',
});
```

## Grouping Traces by Users and Sessions

Many real-world applications use sessions to maintain multi-turn user interactions. On the other hand, traces are often generated per-request. MLflow supports grouping traces by user sessions to help you understand an end-user's journey and identify issues. Refer to the [Track Users & Sessions](/genai/tracing/track-users-sessions) guide for more details.

## FAQ

#### Q. I found a feature in the Python SDK that is not available in the Typescript SDK.

The Typescript SDK started later than the Python SDK, so some features are not available yet. Please raise a feature request in [GitHub](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/new/choose) to get the attention of the maintainers.

#### Q. Do I need to install Python to use MLflow Typescript SDK?

Your application doesn't need to have Python installed. However, if you want to send traces to the self-hosted MLflow server, your server environment needs to have Python.

Alternatively, you can sign-up for [Managed MLflow](https://mlflow.org/#get-started) for free and send traces to the cloud-hosted MLflow server.
