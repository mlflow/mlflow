# Instrument your app

Learn how to instrument your GenAI application with MLflow Tracing to capture and visualize the execution flow of your application. MLflow offers two main approaches to implementing tracing that can be used independently or together for comprehensive observability.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires the following packages:

**mlflow>=3.1**: Core MLflow functionality with GenAI features.

**openai>=1.0.0**: Only required to run the [Quick Start Examples](#quick-start-examples) below (if using other LLM providers, install their respective SDKs instead)

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "mlflow>=3.1" openai>=1.0.0
```

:::note[MLflow Version Recommendation]
While tracing features are available starting in MLflow 2.15.0+, **it is strongly recommended to install MLflow 3** for the latest GenAI capabilities, including expanded tracing features, enhanced evaluation capabilities, and an improved UI.
:::

## Environment Setup

Before running the examples below, configure your environment:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local MLflow" default>
    For local development, start the MLflow tracking server:

    ```bash
    mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
    ```

    Then configure your tracking URI:

    ```python
    import mlflow

    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:5000")
    mlflow.set_experiment("my-tracing-experiment")
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="remote" label="Remote Server">
    For remote MLflow servers, configure the tracking URI:

    ```python
    import mlflow

    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("https://your-mlflow-server.com")
    mlflow.set_experiment("my-tracing-experiment")
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="databricks" label="Databricks">
    If you're working on tracing with Databricks, configure your authentication:

    ```python
    import os

    # Set Databricks authentication (only needed when running outside Databricks)
    os.environ["DATABRICKS_HOST"] = "https://your-workspace.databricks.com"
    os.environ["DATABRICKS_TOKEN"] = "your-databricks-token"
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Tracing Approaches

MLflow provides two complementary approaches to tracing:

**[Automatic Tracing](#automatic-tracing)**: Just add 1 line of code `mlflow.<library>.autolog()` to automatically capture your app's logic. Automatic tracing works with 20+ [supported libraries and frameworks](/genai/tracing/integrations) out of the box

**[Manual Tracing](#manual-tracing)**: Designed for custom logic and complex workflows, manual tracing gives you full control over what gets traced and how using [high-level APIs (decorators and fluent context managers)](manual-tracing/fluent-apis) or [low-level APIs](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing/low-level-api).

:::note
Automatic and manual tracing can be used together. For example, you could use the auto-tracing for OpenAI's SDK and manual tracing to combine multiple LLM calls into a single trace that represents your application's end to end logic.
:::

## Quick Start Examples

### Automatic Tracing Example

Enable automatic tracing for your favorite library with just one line of code:

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Set up environment (if not already configured)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# Set up MLflow tracking
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("auto-tracing-demo")

# Enable automatic tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Your existing code works unchanged
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is MLflow?"}],
    max_tokens=100,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
# Traces are automatically captured and logged!
```

### Manual Tracing Example

Use the `@mlflow.trace` decorator to instrument your custom functions:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import SpanType
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Set up environment (if not already configured)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# Set up MLflow tracking
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("manual-tracing-demo")

# Enable automatic tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()


@mlflow.trace(name="RAG Pipeline", span_type=SpanType.CHAIN)
def answer_question(question: str) -> str:
    """A simple RAG pipeline with manual tracing."""

    # Step 1: Retrieve context (manually traced)
    context = retrieve_context(question)

    # Step 2: Generate answer (automatically traced by OpenAI autolog)
    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": f"Context: {context}"},
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
        max_tokens=150,
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content


@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.RETRIEVER)
def retrieve_context(question: str) -> str:
    """Simulate context retrieval."""
    # Simulate retrieval logic
    return f"Relevant context for: {question}"


# Execute the traced pipeline
result = answer_question("What is MLflow Tracing?")
print(result)
```

:::tip
Generally, we recommend starting with [automatic tracing](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic) and only moving to [manual tracing](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing) if your application's logic is not accurately captured or you need more control.
:::

## Automatic Tracing

Automatic tracing provides zero-code observability for supported libraries. Simply call the autolog function for your library and MLflow will automatically capture all relevant operations.

MLflow supports automatic tracing for 20+ popular GenAI libraries including LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock), frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, DSPy). See the complete list at [Automatic Tracing Integrations](/genai/tracing/integrations).

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.openai.autolog()
```

You can enable autolog for multiple libraries simultaneously by calling each autolog function. For example, to enable autolog for OpenAI and LangChain, you can do:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.openai.autolog()
mlflow.langchain.autolog()
```

## Manual Tracing

Manual tracing gives you fine-grained control over what gets traced and how. Use it to instrument custom logic, combine operations into logical units, or add custom metadata.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="decorator" label="@mlflow.trace Decorator" default>
    The decorator approach is ideal for instrumenting functions:

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow.entities import SpanType


    @mlflow.trace(name="Document Processor", span_type=SpanType.CHAIN)
    def process_document(document: str, language: str = "en") -> dict:
        """Process a document through multiple steps."""

        # This entire function execution will be traced
        tokens = tokenize(document)
        entities = extract_entities(tokens, language)
        summary = generate_summary(tokens)

        return {"entities": entities, "summary": summary, "token_count": len(tokens)}
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="context-manager" label="Context Manager">
    Use context managers for instrumenting code blocks:

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow.entities import SpanType


    def complex_pipeline(data):
        with mlflow.start_span(name="Data Validation", span_type=SpanType.UNKNOWN) as span:
            validated_data = validate_input(data)
            span.set_attribute("validation_errors", len(validated_data.errors))

        with mlflow.start_span(name="Model Prediction", span_type=SpanType.LLM) as span:
            prediction = model.predict(validated_data)
            span.set_attribute("confidence", prediction.confidence)

        return prediction
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="combining" label="Combining with Auto Tracing">
    The most powerful approach combines both automatic and manual tracing:

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow.entities import SpanType
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Enable automatic tracing for OpenAI
    mlflow.openai.autolog()


    @mlflow.trace(name="RAG Pipeline", span_type=SpanType.CHAIN)
    def rag_pipeline(question: str) -> str:
        """A RAG pipeline with both manual and automatic tracing."""

        # Manual tracing for custom retrieval logic
        with mlflow.start_span(
            name="Document Retrieval", span_type=SpanType.RETRIEVER
        ) as span:
            relevant_docs = search_documents(question)
            span.set_attribute("documents_retrieved", len(relevant_docs))

        # Automatic tracing for OpenAI call (via autolog)
        client = OpenAI()
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": f"Context: {relevant_docs}"},
                {"role": "user", "content": question},
            ],
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Span Types and Attributes

Enhance your traces with proper categorization and metadata using span types like `SpanType.CHAIN`, `SpanType.LLM`, `SpanType.RETRIEVER`, `SpanType.EMBEDDING`, and others. Add custom attributes using `span.set_attribute()` to capture important metadata about your operations.

Learn more about manual tracing techniques, decorators, context managers, and advanced patterns in the [Manual Tracing Guide](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/manual-tracing).

## View Logged Traces

After instrumenting your application, you can view and analyze your traces in several ways:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mlflow-ui" label="MLflow UI" default>
    After logging your traces, you can view them in the [MLflow UI](/genai/tracing/observe-with-traces/ui), under the "Traces" tab in the main experiment page. This tab is also available within the individual run pages, if your trace was logged within a run context.

    ![MLflow Tracking UI](/images/llms/tracing/trace-experiment-ui.png)

    This table includes high-level information about the traces, such as the trace ID, the inputs / outputs of the root span, and more. From this page, you can also perform a few actions to manage your traces:

    **Search**: Using the search bar in the UI, you can easily filter your traces based on name, tags, or other metadata. Check out the [search docs](/genai/tracing/search-traces) for details about the query string format.

    ![Searching traces](/images/llms/tracing/trace-session-id.gif)

    **Delete**: The UI supports bulk deletion of traces. Simply select the traces you want to delete by checking the checkboxes, and then pressing the "Delete" button.

    ![Deleting traces](/images/llms/tracing/trace-delete.gif)

    **Edit Tags**: You can also edit key-value tags on your traces via the UI.

    ![Traces tag update](/images/llms/tracing/trace-set-tag.gif)

    To browse the span data of an individual trace, simply click on the link in the "Trace ID" or "Trace name" columns to open the trace viewer:

    ![Trace Browser](/images/llms/tracing/tracing-top.gif)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jupyter" label="Jupyter Notebooks">
    :::note
    The MLflow Tracing Jupyter integration is available in **MLflow 2.20 and above**
    :::

    You can also view the trace UI directly within Jupyter notebooks, allowing you to debug your applications without having to tab out of your development environment.

    ![Jupyter Trace UI](/images/llms/tracing/jupyter-trace-ui.png)

    This feature requires using an [MLflow Tracking Server](/ml/tracking/server), as this is where the UI assets are fetched from. To get started, simply ensure that the MLflow Tracking URI is set to your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")`).

    By default, the trace UI will automatically be displayed for the following events:

    **When the cell code generates a trace** (e.g. via [automatic tracing](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic), or by running a manually traced function)

    **When <APILink fn="mlflow.search_traces" /> is called**

    **When a <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Trace" /> object is displayed** (e.g. via IPython's `display` function, or when it is the last value returned in a cell)

    To disable the display, simply call <APILink fn="mlflow.tracing.disable_notebook_display" />, and rerun the cell containing the UI. To enable it again, call <APILink fn="mlflow.tracing.enable_notebook_display" />.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="programmatic" label="Programmatic Access">
    Query and analyze traces programmatically:

    ```python
    import mlflow

    # Search for traces with specific criteria
    traces = mlflow.search_traces(
        experiment_ids=["1"],
        filter_string="attributes.model_name = 'gpt-4o-mini'",
        max_results=100,
    )

    # Get a specific trace
    trace = mlflow.get_trace("trace-id-here")
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
