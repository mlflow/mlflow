# Collect User Feedback

Collecting and logging user feedback is essential for understanding the real-world quality of your GenAI application. User feedback provides ground truth about your application's performance and helps identify areas for improvement.

## Why Collect User Feedback?

User feedback provides critical insights that automated metrics cannot capture:

1. **Real-world quality signals** - Understand how actual users perceive your application's outputs
2. **Continuous improvement** - Identify patterns in user satisfaction to guide development priorities
3. **Training data creation** - Use feedback to build high-quality evaluation datasets
4. **Quality monitoring** - Track satisfaction trends over time and across different user segments
5. **Model optimization** - Leverage feedback data to improve your underlying models

## Types of Feedback

Different feedback mechanisms serve different purposes in understanding user satisfaction:

| Feedback Type            | Description                                | Common Use Cases                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Binary feedback**      | Simple thumbs up/down or correct/incorrect | Quick user satisfaction signals      |
| **Numeric scores**       | Ratings on a scale (e.g., 1-5 stars)       | Detailed quality assessment          |
| **Categorical feedback** | Multiple choice options                    | Classifying issues or response types |
| **Text feedback**        | Free-form comments                         | Detailed user explanations           |

## Feedback Collection Patterns

### Linking Feedback to Traces

The key to effective feedback collection is connecting user feedback back to the specific interaction that generated it. This enables you to:

- Understand which types of requests lead to positive or negative feedback
- Analyze the relationship between application performance and user satisfaction
- Build evaluation datasets from real user interactions

### Request Tracking Approach

Use unique request identifiers to link feedback to specific traces:

1. **Generate unique IDs** for each user interaction
2. **Associate IDs with traces** using tags or metadata
3. **Collect feedback** referencing the same ID
4. **Store feedback** alongside trace data for analysis

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing feedback collection:

**Frontend Integration:**

- Make feedback collection frictionless (simple thumbs up/down)
- Provide optional detailed feedback for users who want to elaborate
- Consider contextual timing for feedback requests

**Backend Storage:**

- Link feedback to trace identifiers
- Store feedback metadata (user ID, timestamp, context)
- Consider privacy requirements and data anonymization

**Analysis Integration:**

- Query feedback alongside trace performance data
- Track feedback trends over time
- Identify correlations between trace characteristics and user satisfaction

## Using Trace Tags for Feedback

While dedicated feedback APIs are in development, you can implement feedback collection using MLflow's trace tagging system:

### Tagging Strategy

Use consistent tag naming conventions to organize feedback data:

- `feedback_received: true/false` - Whether feedback was provided
- `feedback_positive: true/false` - Binary satisfaction indicator
- `feedback_rating: 1-5` - Numeric satisfaction score
- `feedback_category: helpful/unhelpful/incorrect` - Categorical feedback
- `feedback_user: user_123` - User identifier (consider anonymization)

### Feedback Analysis

Query traces with feedback tags to analyze patterns:

```python
import mlflow

# Find traces with positive feedback
positive_feedback_traces = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=["1"],
    filter_string="tags.feedback_positive = 'true'",
    max_results=100,
)

# Find traces with negative feedback
negative_feedback_traces = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=["1"],
    filter_string="tags.feedback_positive = 'false'",
    max_results=100,
)

# Compare characteristics
print(f"Positive feedback traces: {len(positive_feedback_traces)}")
print(f"Negative feedback traces: {len(negative_feedback_traces)}")
```

## Feedback Collection Best Practices

### 1. Minimize User Friction

- **Simple interfaces**: Start with binary thumbs up/down
- **Progressive detail**: Allow optional detailed feedback
- **Contextual timing**: Ask for feedback at natural stopping points

### 2. Preserve User Privacy

- **Anonymize identifiers**: Use hashed or pseudonymous user IDs
- **Limit data collection**: Only collect necessary feedback information
- **Data retention**: Implement appropriate retention policies

### 3. Design for Analysis

- **Consistent tagging**: Use standardized tag names across your application
- **Structured data**: Store feedback in queryable formats
- **Temporal tracking**: Include timestamps for trend analysis

### 4. Handle Edge Cases

- **Rate limiting**: Prevent feedback spam or abuse
- **Validation**: Ensure feedback data quality
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handle feedback collection failures

## Analyzing Feedback Data

### Performance Correlation

Analyze the relationship between trace performance and user satisfaction:

```python
# Compare execution times for positive vs negative feedback
positive_times = [trace.info.execution_time_ms for trace in positive_feedback_traces]
negative_times = [trace.info.execution_time_ms for trace in negative_feedback_traces]

if positive_times and negative_times:
    avg_positive_time = sum(positive_times) / len(positive_times)
    avg_negative_time = sum(negative_times) / len(negative_times)

    print(f"Average time for positive feedback: {avg_positive_time:.2f}ms")
    print(f"Average time for negative feedback: {avg_negative_time:.2f}ms")
```

### Quality Trends

Track feedback trends over time to monitor application quality:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get feedback from the last week
week_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
timestamp_ms = int(week_ago.timestamp() * 1000)

recent_feedback = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=["1"],
    filter_string=f"timestamp_ms > {timestamp_ms} AND tags.feedback_received = 'true'",
    max_results=500,
)

# Calculate satisfaction rate
positive_count = len(
    [t for t in recent_feedback if t.data.tags.get("feedback_positive") == "true"]
)
satisfaction_rate = positive_count / len(recent_feedback) if recent_feedback else 0

print(f"Weekly satisfaction rate: {satisfaction_rate:.2%}")
```

### Building Evaluation Datasets

Use feedback data to create evaluation datasets:

```python
# Extract high-quality interactions for evaluation datasets
high_quality_traces = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=["1"],
    filter_string="tags.feedback_positive = 'true' AND tags.feedback_rating >= '4'",
    max_results=200,
)

print(f"Found {len(high_quality_traces)} high-quality interactions")
print("These can be used as positive examples in evaluation datasets")
```

## Integration Examples

### Web Application Feedback

Implement feedback collection in web applications by:

1. **Generating request IDs** when processing user requests
2. **Returning IDs** in API responses for frontend reference
3. **Collecting feedback** via separate endpoints that reference the ID
4. **Tagging traces** with received feedback data

### Chat Interface Feedback

For conversational interfaces:

1. **Track conversation context** with session identifiers
2. **Enable turn-level feedback** for individual responses
3. **Support conversation-level feedback** for overall satisfaction
4. **Link feedback** to specific turns or entire conversations

### API Integration Feedback

For API-based applications:

1. **Include feedback endpoints** in your API design
2. **Support batch feedback** for multiple interactions
3. **Provide feedback schemas** for consistent data collection
4. **Document feedback patterns** for API consumers

## Production Considerations

### Monitoring Feedback Health

Track key metrics to ensure effective feedback collection:

- **Feedback collection rate**: Percentage of interactions that receive feedback
- **Response time impact**: Ensure feedback collection doesn't slow down responses
- **Data quality**: Monitor for spam or invalid feedback
- **User engagement**: Track which feedback mechanisms are most effective

### Scalability

Design feedback systems that scale with your application:

- **Asynchronous processing**: Handle feedback collection without blocking responses
- **Batch operations**: Process feedback in batches for efficiency
- **Storage optimization**: Use appropriate storage systems for feedback volume
- **Query performance**: Ensure feedback queries remain fast as data grows
