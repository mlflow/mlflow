# Collect User Feedback

Capturing user feedback is critical for understanding the real-world quality of your GenAI application. MLflow's **Feedback API** provides a structured, standardized approach to collecting, storing, and analyzing user feedback directly within your traces.

## Why Use MLflow Feedback for User Feedback?

## Step-by-Step Guide: Collecting User Feedback

### 1. Set Up Your GenAI Application with Tracing

First, create a simple application that automatically generates traces using MLflow's OpenAI autologging:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import AssessmentSource, AssessmentSourceType
import openai

# Enable automatic tracing for OpenAI calls
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Initialize your LLM client
client = openai.OpenAI()


def ask_question(question):
    """Simple Q&A application with automatic tracing."""
    # This call is automatically traced by MLflow
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions clearly and concisely.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    answer = response.choices[0].message.content
    return answer


# Generate some traces - each call creates a trace automatically
question = "What is machine learning?"
answer = ask_question(question)
print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")

# You can get the trace ID from the MLflow UI or search API
# For this example, we'll show how to collect feedback programmatically
```

### 2. Collect Simple Thumbs Up/Down Feedback

Implement basic boolean feedback collection. In a real application, you'd get the trace_id from your tracing system:

```python
def collect_thumbs_feedback(trace_id, is_helpful, user_id):
    """Collect simple thumbs up/down feedback from users."""
    mlflow.log_feedback(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        name="user_satisfaction",
        value=is_helpful,
        rationale="User indicated response was helpful"
        if is_helpful
        else "User indicated response was not helpful",
        source=AssessmentSource(
            source_type=AssessmentSourceType.HUMAN, source_id=user_id
        ),
    )
    print(f"✓ Feedback recorded: {'👍' if is_helpful else '👎'}")


# Example: Collect feedback on a trace
trace_id = mlflow.get_last_active_trace_id()
collect_thumbs_feedback(trace_id, True, "user_123")
```

### 3. View Feedback in MLflow UI

After collecting feedback, you can view it in the MLflow UI:

<ImageBox
  src={AssessmentsTraceDetailImageUrl}
  alt="Feedback in MLflow UI"
  width="90%"
/>

The trace detail page shows all feedback attached to your traces, making it easy to analyze user satisfaction and identify patterns in your application's performance.

### 4. Adding and Updating Feedback via UI

Users can also provide feedback directly through the MLflow UI:

**Creating New Feedback:**

<ImageBox
  src={AddFeedbackImageUrl}
  alt="Create Feedback"
  width="90%"
/>

**Adding Additional Feedback:**

<ImageBox
  src={AdditionalFeedbackImageUrl}
  alt="Additional Feedback"
  width="90%"
/>

This collaborative approach enables both programmatic feedback collection and manual review workflows.

## Feedback Value Types

MLflow feedback supports various formats to match your application's needs:

| Feedback Type   | Description                              | Example Use Cases                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Boolean**     | Simple `True`/`False` feedback           | Thumbs up/down, correct/incorrect   |
| **Numeric**     | Integer or float ratings                 | 1-5 star ratings, confidence scores |
| **Categorical** | String classifications                   | "Helpful", "Neutral", "Unhelpful"   |
| **Structured**  | Complex objects with multiple dimensions | Detailed quality breakdowns         |
