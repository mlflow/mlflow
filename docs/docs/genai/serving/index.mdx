# MLflow Model Serving

MLflow provides comprehensive model serving capabilities to deploy your machine learning models as REST APIs for real-time inference. Whether you're working with MLflow OSS or Databricks Managed MLflow, you can serve models locally, in cloud environments, or through managed endpoints.

## Overview

MLflow serving transforms your trained models into production-ready inference servers that can handle HTTP requests and return predictions. The serving infrastructure supports various deployment patterns, from local development servers to scalable cloud deployments.

### Key Features

- **🔌 REST API Endpoints**: Automatic generation of standardized REST endpoints for model inference
- **🧬 Multiple Model Formats**: Support for various ML frameworks through MLflow's flavor system
- **🧠 Custom Applications**: Build sophisticated serving applications with custom logic and preprocessing
- **📈 Scalable Deployment**: Deploy to various targets including local servers, cloud platforms, and Kubernetes
- **🗂️ Model Registry Integration**: Seamless integration with MLflow Model Registry for version management

## Serving Options

### MLflow OSS Serving

MLflow open-source provides several serving options:

- **Local Serving**: Quick deployment for development and testing using <Link to="/api_reference/cli.html#mlflow-models-serve" target="_blank">`mlflow models serve`</Link>
- **Custom PyFunc Models**: Advanced serving with custom preprocessing, postprocessing, and business logic
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized serving for consistent deployment across environments
- **Cloud Platform Integration**: Deploy to AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, and other cloud services

### Databricks Managed MLflow

Databricks provides additional managed serving capabilities:

- **Model Serving Endpoints**: Fully managed, auto-scaling endpoints with built-in monitoring
- **Foundation Model APIs**: Direct access to foundation models through pay-per-token endpoints
- **Advanced Security**: Enterprise-grade security with access controls and audit logging
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Built-in metrics, logging, and performance monitoring

## Quick Start

### Basic Model Serving

For a simple model serving setup:

```bash
# Serve a logged model
mlflow models serve -m "models:/<model-id>" -p 5000

# Serve a registered model
mlflow models serve -m "models:/<model-name>/<model-version>" -p 5000

# Serve a model from local path
mlflow models serve -m ./path/to/model -p 5000
```

### Making Predictions

Once your model is served, you can make predictions via HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"inputs": [[1, 2, 3, 4]]}'
```

## Architecture

MLflow serving uses a standardized architecture:

1. **🧠 Model Loading**: Models are loaded using their respective MLflow flavors
2. **🌐 HTTP Server**: FastAPI-based server handles incoming requests
3. **🔄 Prediction Pipeline**: Requests are processed through the model's predict method
4. **📦 Response Formatting**: Results are returned in standardized JSON format

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate hardware resources based on model requirements
- Implement request batching for improved throughput
- Consider model quantization for faster inference
- Monitor memory usage and optimize accordingly

### Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Validate input data to prevent security vulnerabilities
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security issues

### Monitoring and Observability

- Set up comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing
- Monitor key metrics like latency, throughput, and error rates
- Implement health checks for service reliability
- Use distributed tracing for complex serving pipelines

## Common Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="real-time-inference" label="Real-time Inference">
    Serve models for real-time predictions in web applications, mobile apps, or
    microservices architectures.

    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    # Single prediction
    data = {
        "dataframe_split": {
            "columns": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"],
            "data": [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]],
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:5000/invocations",
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        data=json.dumps(data),
    )
    print(response.json())
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="batch-processing" label="Batch Processing">
    Use serving endpoints for batch inference on large datasets with controlled
    resource usage.

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from pyspark.sql.functions import col, struct

    # Parameters
    model_name = "YOUR_MODEL_NAME"
    model_version = "YOUR_MODEL_VERSION"
    input_table = "YOUR_INPUT_TABLE_NAME"
    output_table = "YOUR_OUTPUT_TABLE_NAME"

    # Load data
    df = spark.table(input_table)

    # Apply model using Spark UDF
    model_uri = f"models:/{model_name}/{model_version}"
    predict_udf = mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf(spark, model_uri)

    # Make predictions
    predictions_df = df.withColumn(
        "prediction", predict_udf(struct([col(c) for c in df.columns]))
    )

    # Save results
    predictions_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(output_table)
    ```

    See [Databricks batch inference documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/large-language-models/ai-query-batch-inference#batch-llm-inference-using-ai_query) for built-in batch inference support with AI Functions on a deployed serving endpoint.
