# Track versions of Git-based applications with MLflow

:::warning

- This feature is experimental and may change in future releases.
- This feature is not supported in [Databricks Git Folders](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/repos/) yet due to limitations in accessing Git metadata.
- MLflow >= 3.4 is required for this feature.

:::

This guide demonstrates how to track versions of your GenAI application when your app's code resides in Git or a similar version control system. MLflow provides automatic Git-based versioning through the <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning" /> API, which seamlessly tracks your application versions based on Git state.

When enabled, MLflow automatically:

- Creates or reuses a LoggedModel based on your current [git state](.#git-state-tracked-by-mlflow)
- Links all traces to this `LoggedModel` version
- Captures Git metadata including diffs for uncommitted changes
- Manages version transitions as your code evolves

### Git State Tracked by MLflow

MLflow tracks three key components of your Git state:

- **Branch**: The Git branch name (e.g., `main`, `feature-xyz`)
- **Commit**: The Git commit hash uniquely identifying the code version
- **Dirty State**: Whether your working directory has uncommitted changes. A "dirty" repository means there are modifications that haven't been committed yet. MLflow captures these changes as a diff to ensure complete reproducibility

## Why Git-Based Versioning Works for GenAI

Git-based versioning transforms your version control system into a powerful application lifecycle management tool. Every commit becomes a potential application version, with complete code history and change tracking built-in.

## How MLflow Captures Git Context

With <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning" />, MLflow automatically manages version tracking based on your Git state. Each unique combination of branch, commit, and dirty state creates or reuses a LoggedModel version.

  },

  }
]} />

## Prerequisites

Install MLflow and required packages:

```bash
pip install "mlflow>=3.4" openai
```

Set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Create an MLflow experiment by following the [getting started guide](/ml/getting-started).

## Step 1: Enable Git-based version tracking

The simplest way to enable Git-based version tracking is to call <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning" /> at the start of your application:

```python
import mlflow

# Enable Git-based version tracking
# This automatically creates/reuses a LoggedModel based on your Git state
context = mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning()

# Check which version is active
print(
    f"Active version - Branch: {context.info.branch}, Commit: {context.info.commit[:8]}"
)
print(f"Repository dirty: {context.info.dirty}")
```

You can also use it as a context manager for scoped versioning:

```python
with mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning() as context:
    # All traces within this block are linked to the Git-based version
    # Your application code here
    ...

# Version tracking is automatically disabled when exiting the context
```

## Step 2: Create your application

Now let's create a simple application that will be automatically versioned:

```python
import mlflow
import openai

# Enable Git-based version tracking
context = mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning()

# Enable MLflow's autologging to instrument your application with Tracing
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Set up OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI()


# Use the trace decorator to capture the application's entry point
@mlflow.trace
def my_app(input: str) -> str:
    """Customer support agent application"""
    # This call is automatically instrumented by `mlflow.openai.autolog()`
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful customer support agent."},
            {"role": "user", "content": input},
        ],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=150,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


# Test the application - traces are automatically linked to the Git version
result = my_app(input="What is MLflow?")
print(result)
```

:::note

When you run this code, MLflow automatically:

1. Detects your Git repository state (branch, commit, dirty status)
2. Creates or reuses a LoggedModel matching this state
3. Links all traces to this version
4. Captures uncommitted changes as diffs if the repository is dirty

:::

## Step 3: Test version tracking with code changes

Run your application and observe how versions are tracked:

```python
# Initial run - creates a LoggedModel for current Git state
result = my_app(input="What is MLflow?")
print(result)

result = my_app(input="What is Databricks?")
print(result)
# Both traces are linked to the same version since Git state hasn't changed
```

To see how MLflow tracks changes, modify your code (without committing) and run again:

```python
# Make a change to your application code (e.g., modify temperature)
# The repository is now "dirty" with uncommitted changes

# Re-enable versioning - MLflow will detect the dirty state
context = mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning()
print(f"Repository dirty: {context.info.dirty}")  # Will show True

# This trace will be linked to a different version (same commit but dirty=True)
result = my_app(input="What is GenAI?")
print(result)
```

:::tip
MLflow creates distinct versions for:

- Different Git branches
- Different commits
- Clean vs. dirty repository states

This ensures complete reproducibility of your application versions.
:::

## Step 5: View traces linked to the LoggedModel

### Use the UI

Go to the MLflow Experiment UI. In the **Traces** tab, you can see the version of the app that generated each trace. In the **Models** tab, you can see each LoggedModel alongside its parameters and linked traces.

<ImageBox src={GitVersioningImage} altText="Git Versioning" width="80%" />

### Use the SDK

You can use <APILink fn="mlflow.search_traces" /> to query for traces from a LoggedModel:

```python
import mlflow

# Using the context from enable_git_model_versioning()
context = mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning()

traces = mlflow.search_traces(model_id=context.active_model.model_id)
print(traces)
```

You can use <APILink fn="mlflow.get_logged_model" /> to get details of the LoggedModel including Git metadata:

```python
import mlflow
import datetime

# Get the active Git-based version
context = mlflow.genai.enable_git_model_versioning()

# Get LoggedModel metadata
logged_model = mlflow.get_logged_model(model_id=context.active_model.model_id)

# Inspect basic properties
print(f"\n=== LoggedModel Information ===")
print(logged_model)

# Access Git metadata from tags
print(f"\n=== Git Information ===")
git_tags = {k: v for k, v in logged_model.tags.items() if k.startswith("mlflow.git")}
for tag_key, tag_value in git_tags.items():
    if tag_key == "mlflow.git.diff" and len(tag_value) > 100:
        print(f"{tag_key}: <diff with {len(tag_value)} characters>")
    else:
        print(f"{tag_key}: {tag_value}")
```
