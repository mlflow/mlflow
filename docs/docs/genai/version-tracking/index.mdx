# Version Tracking for GenAI Applications

MLflow's **<APILink fn="mlflow.entities.LoggedModel">LoggedModel</APILink>** provides systematic version control for your entire GenAI application—code, configurations, evaluations, and traces. Stop losing track of what works and start building with confidence through complete application lifecycle management.

## Why Version Control Matters for GenAI

GenAI applications are complex systems with interdependent components. Without systematic versioning, development becomes chaotic and deployments risky.

## How LoggedModel Powers GenAI Version Control

MLflow's LoggedModel adapts traditional ML model versioning for GenAI applications. Instead of just tracking model weights, it becomes a comprehensive metadata hub that coordinates all the moving parts of your AI system.

<ConceptOverview concepts={[

    title: "Application State Snapshots",
    description: "Each LoggedModel version captures a complete application state—code references, configurations, dependencies, and performance data in one versioned entity."

## Start Version Tracking in 5 Minutes

Transform chaotic GenAI development into systematic version control with just a few lines of code.

### Automatic Version Tracking with Git Integration

Link your application versions to git commits for complete traceability:

```python
import mlflow
import openai
import os

# Fix: Added missing import
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# Configure MLflow experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("customer-support-agent")

# Get current git commit using MLflow's built-in utilities
from mlflow.utils.git_utils import get_git_commit

git_commit = get_git_commit(".")
if git_commit:
    git_commit = git_commit[:8]  # Use short hash
else:
    git_commit = "local-dev"  # Fallback if not in git repo

# Create version identifier
app_name = "customer_support_agent"
version_name = f"{app_name}-{git_commit}"

# Set active model context - all traces will link to this version
mlflow.set_active_model(name=version_name)

# Enable automatic tracing
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Your application code - now automatically versioned and traced
client = openai.OpenAI()
test_questions = [
    "How do I reset my password?",
    "What are your business hours?",
    "Can I get a refund for my order?",
]

for question in test_questions:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=1000,
    )
    # ✅ Automatically: traced, versioned, and linked to git commit
```

**What happens automatically:**

- Every LLM call generates a detailed trace
- All traces link to your specific application version
- Git commit provides exact code reproducibility
- Version performance can be compared objectively

### Version Management Made Simple

```python
# Create a new version for experimentation
with mlflow.set_active_model(name=f"agent-v2-{new_commit}"):
    # Test new prompt engineering approach
    improved_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful customer support agent. Be concise and actionable.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
        temperature=0.3,  # Lower temperature for consistency
        max_tokens=500,  # More focused responses
    )
    # ✅ New version automatically tracked with different configurations
```

Context manager automatically handles version switching—clean, explicit, and error-free.

### Compare Versions Systematically

```python
import pandas as pd

# Evaluate multiple versions against the same test set
eval_data = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": test_questions,
        "expected_categories": ["account", "business_info", "billing"],
    }
)

# Version A: Original configuration
results_v1 = mlflow.evaluate(
    model_uri=f"models:/{app_name}-{commit_v1}",
    data=eval_data,
    extra_metrics=[
        mlflow.metrics.toxicity(),
        mlflow.metrics.latency(),
        mlflow.metrics.flesch_kincaid_grade_level(),
    ],
)

# Version B: Improved prompts
results_v2 = mlflow.evaluate(
    model_uri=f"models:/{app_name}-{commit_v2}",
    data=eval_data,
    extra_metrics=[
        mlflow.metrics.toxicity(),
        mlflow.metrics.latency(),
        mlflow.metrics.flesch_kincaid_grade_level(),
    ],
)

# ✅ Side-by-side comparison shows which version performs better
```

Objective metrics remove guesswork from version selection.

## Prerequisites

Ready to implement systematic version tracking? You'll need:

- **MLflow 3.0+** (`pip install --upgrade "mlflow>=3.1"`)
- **Git repository** for your application code
- **Python 3.10+**
- **LLM API access** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

:::tip
For Databricks-hosted MLflow Tracking: `pip install --upgrade "mlflow[databricks]>=3.1"`
