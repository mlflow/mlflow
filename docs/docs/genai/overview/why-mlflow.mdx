## Core Capabilities for GenAI

### 🔍 Complete Observability with Tracing

See inside every AI decision with comprehensive tracing that captures the full execution flow.

**What you get:**

- **Automatic instrumentation** for 20+ frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI, LlamaIndex, etc.)
- **Detailed execution logs** showing every step, tool call, and decision
- **Interactive debugging** in Jupyter notebooks and IDEs
- **Production monitoring** with OpenTelemetry compatibility for exported traces

**Why it matters**: You can't fix what you can't see. MLflow shows you exactly how your AI makes decisions.

```python
import mlflow

# One line to enable comprehensive tracing
mlflow.langchain.autolog()

# Your app is now fully observable
chain.invoke({"question": "How do I reset my password?"})
# MLflow captures every LLM call, retrieval, and tool use
```

### 📊 AI-Powered Quality Evaluation

Move beyond manual testing with automated evaluation using LLM judges and custom metrics.

**What you get:**

- **Pre-built LLM judges** for correctness, relevance, safety, and more
- **Custom metric creation** for domain-specific quality measures
- **Bulk evaluation** across entire datasets

**Why it matters**: Systematically measure and improve quality instead of guessing.

:::note
The GenAI Evaluate feature is only available on Databricks Managed MLflow.
:::

```python
from mlflow.genai.scorers import Correctness, RelevanceToQuery

# Evaluate your app with AI-powered metrics
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    predict_fn=my_app,
    data=eval_dataset,
    scorers=[
        Correctness(),
        RelevanceToQuery(),
    ],
)
```

### 📝 Prompt & Version Management

Track every change to your AI application with comprehensive version control.

**What you get:**

- **Prompt registry** with Git-like version control
- **Visual prompt editor** for no-code iteration
- **Complete lineage tracking** from development to deployment

**Why it matters**: Know exactly what changed and why, enabling rapid iteration with confidence.

### 🚀 Flexible Deployment Options

Deploy your AI applications anywhere with consistent APIs and monitoring.

**What you get:**

- **Multiple deployment targets**: REST APIs, serverless, containers
- **Native integration**: Deploy to popular cloud services and serving stacks with ease
- **AI Gateway** for unified LLM provider management

**Why it matters**: Focus on building great AI, not deployment infrastructure.

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Ready Governance

Secure and govern your AI deployments with enterprise-grade features.

**What you get:**

- **Centralized API key management** through AI Gateway
- **Unity Catalog integration** for data governance on Databricks managed MLflow
- **Audit trails** for all model changes and deployments
- **Role-based access control** for teams with Unity Catalog integration

**Why it matters**: Deploy AI responsibly with proper security and compliance.

## MLflow vs. Alternatives

### vs. Building In-House

### vs. Point Solutions

Many teams cobble together multiple tools:

- Tracing tool + Evaluation framework + Experiment tracking + Deployment solution = **Complexity**

MLflow provides everything in one integrated platform:

- **Unified experience**: One UI, one API, one mental model
- **Integrated workflows**: Traces → Evaluation → Deployment
- **Consistent metrics**: Same scorers in dev and production
- **Single source of truth**: All AI assets in one place

## Getting Started is Simple

Install MLflow

```shell
pip install --upgrade mlflow
```

And get to work.

```python
# Start tracing your app
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

mlflow.set_experiment("my-genai-app")
# set an active model for grouping traces
mlflow.set_active_model(name="my-app")

# enable tracing for openai
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Run your application
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "State that you are responding to a test and that you are alive.",
    }
]

openai_client = OpenAI()
openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.95,
)
# You're now on the path to production-ready AI!
```
