# Key Challenges in Developing GenAI Applications

MLflow is built to address the fundamental challenge in delivering production-ready GenAI apps: **It is difficult to create apps that reliably deliver high-quality (accurate) responses at the optimal cost and latency.**

## The Unique Nature of GenAI Applications

Unlike traditional software with predictable inputs and outputs, GenAI applications operate in an open-ended language space where both inputs and outputs are unpredictable, context-dependent, and constantly evolving. This creates unprecedented challenges for development, testing, and quality assurance.

## Core Challenges

### 1. üó£Ô∏è User Inputs Are Free-Form, Plain Language

**Challenge**: A single user intent can be expressed in countless ways, and your application must correctly understand them all.

**Why it matters**: Traditional software expects structured inputs (like form fields or API parameters). GenAI apps must handle the infinite variety of human expression.

**Example**: Consider a customer support chatbot. These queries all express the same intent:
- "My Wi-Fi keeps dropping‚Äîplease fix it"
- "Can you help? The internet here is dead"
- "Connection issues again... this is so frustrating!"
- "Why does my network disconnect every few minutes?"

Your app must recognize these as the same issue despite completely different wording, emotional tone, and level of technical detail.

### 2. üìà User Inputs Evolve Over Time

**Challenge**: Popular queries and the way users express them shift continuously, even when your code remains unchanged.

**Why it matters**: A perfectly functioning app can degrade over time as user behavior changes, making continuous monitoring essential.

**Example**: Your support chatbot was designed to handle "internet outage" queries. Over time, new patterns emerge:
- After a service disruption: "Will I get a bill credit for yesterday's outage?"
- During remote work surge: "Can you upgrade my speed for video calls?"
- Following a competitor's offer: "I saw [competitor] has faster speeds‚Äîcan you match?"

These evolving patterns require ongoing attention to maintain quality.

### 3. üí¨ GenAI Outputs Are Also Free-Form

**Challenge**: Multiple differently-worded responses can be equally correct, making quality assessment complex.

**Why it matters**: You can't use simple string matching or rule-based validation. Quality checks must understand semantic meaning, not just compare text.

**Example**: These responses convey the same solution but use entirely different words:
- "Please power-cycle your modem by unplugging it for 30 seconds"
- "Try turning the router off for half a minute, then plug it back in"
- "Disconnect your internet box from power, wait 30 sec, and reconnect"

Traditional testing would flag these as different, but they're functionally identical.

### 4. üë• Domain Expertise Required for Quality Assessment

**Challenge**: Developers often lack the specialized knowledge to judge response accuracy in specific domains.

**Why it matters**: Without expert validation, apps can confidently provide incorrect or even harmful information.

**Example**: For the modem reset instruction above, you need a network specialist to verify:
- Is 30 seconds the correct duration for all modem models?
- Should users press the reset button or just unplug?
- Are there models where this could cause configuration loss?

Only domain experts can catch these nuances that could frustrate or harm users.

### 5. ‚öñÔ∏è The Quality-Latency-Cost Trade-off

**Challenge**: Every optimization affects multiple dimensions‚Äîfaster and cheaper often means lower quality.

**Why it matters**: Business requirements demand balance. You need systematic ways to measure and optimize across all three dimensions.

**Example**: Consider these model choices for your support chatbot:

| Model | Response Time | Cost per Query | Quality Impact |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| GPT-4o | 3-5 seconds | $0.03 | Handles complex billing questions accurately |
| GPT-4o-mini | 0.5-1 second | $0.003 | May miss nuances in refund policies |
| Fine-tuned Llama | 1-2 seconds | $0.001 | Good for common issues, struggles with edge cases |

Each choice dramatically impacts user experience and operational costs.

## Why Traditional Testing Fails for GenAI

### üö´ Fixed Test Cases Don't Work

Traditional software testing relies on predetermined inputs and expected outputs. GenAI apps face:
- **Infinite input variations**: Users can phrase requests in unlimited ways
- **Context-dependent correctness**: The "right" answer depends on conversation history
- **Evolving expectations**: What users consider helpful changes over time

### üö´ Code Coverage Isn't Meaningful

In traditional software, code coverage indicates test completeness. For GenAI:
- **Prompt changes affect behavior**: Modifying a prompt template changes outputs without touching code
- **Model updates impact quality**: Upgrading to a new model version can break working features
- **External dependencies matter**: Changes in knowledge cutoffs or training data affect responses

### üö´ Binary Pass/Fail Doesn't Apply

Traditional tests either pass or fail. GenAI quality exists on a spectrum:
- **Partial correctness**: Responses can be mostly right with minor issues
- **Subjective quality**: Different users may prefer different response styles
- **Trade-off decisions**: A "worse" response might be acceptable if it's 10x faster

## The Compounding Effect

These challenges don't exist in isolation‚Äîthey compound:

1. **Free-form inputs** + **Evolving patterns** = You can't predict what users will ask tomorrow
2. **Free-form outputs** + **Domain expertise** = You need specialists to evaluate ever-changing responses
3. **Quality trade-offs** + **All of the above** = Every optimization requires re-evaluating across multiple dimensions
