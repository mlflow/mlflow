# Manage Prompt Lifecycles with Aliases

As your collection of prompts grows and your GenAI applications mature, managing the lifecycle of each prompt becomes essential. Aliases in the MLflow Prompt Registry are a powerful feature for orchestrating the journey of a prompt from initial development through testing, staging, and ultimately to production. They also play a key role in governance and maintenance.

This page will guide you on:

- Using aliases to represent different stages in a prompt's lifecycle (e.g., `development`, `testing`, `production`).
- Creating, updating, and deleting prompt aliases via the UI and Python SDK.
- Implementing governance policies for prompt and alias management.
- Strategies for archiving or deprecating old prompts, including version deletion.
- Managing permissions and access control (conceptually, as this often ties into the overall MLflow deployment).

## Using Aliases for Lifecycle Stages

Aliases act as mutable, human-readable pointers to specific (immutable) prompt versions. This makes them ideal for signifying the status or intended use of a prompt version within its lifecycle.

Consider a common set of aliases you might define for a prompt named `customer-faq`:

- `dev` or `development`: Points to the latest version developers are actively working on and iterating. This version might be unstable.
- `staging` or `testing`: Points to a version that has passed initial developer checks and is ready for more rigorous testing by a QA team or a limited set of beta users.
- `production` or `live`: Points to the version that has been thoroughly tested and is currently being used by your live, user-facing application.

**Workflow Example:**

1.  **Development**: Developers create version 1, 2, 3 of `customer-faq`. The `dev` alias always points to the latest (e.g., version 3).
2.  **Promotion to Staging**: Once version 3 is deemed ready for broader testing, the `staging` alias is updated to point to version 3.
    ```python
    # Set a staging alias for a specific version
    mlflow.genai.set_prompt_alias("summarization-prompt", alias="staging", version=2)
    ```
3.  **Testing in Staging**: The application instances in your staging environment are configured to load prompts using the `staging` alias (e.g., `prompts:/customer-faq/staging`). Testers interact with version 3.
4.  **Promotion to Production**: If version 3 passes all staging tests and meets quality criteria, the `production` alias is updated to point to version 3.
    ```python
    # Set a production alias for a specific version
    mlflow.genai.set_prompt_alias("summarization-prompt", alias="production", version=3)
    ```
5.  **Continuous Development**: Meanwhile, developers might start working on version 4, and the `dev` alias would then point to version 4, without affecting `staging` (still on v3) or `production` (still on v3).

## Managing Aliases (Create, Update, Delete)

MLflow provides functionalities to manage aliases both through its UI and the Python SDK.

### Using the MLflow UI

Within the Prompt Registry section of the MLflow UI, you can typically:

- View all aliases associated with a prompt.
- Create new aliases pointing to specific versions.
- Update existing aliases to point to different versions.
- Delete aliases.

### Using the Python SDK

MLflow offers fluent APIs for programmatic alias management:

- `mlflow.genai.set_prompt_alias(name="<prompt_name>", alias="<alias_name>", version="<version_number>")`: Creates a new alias or updates an existing one.
- `mlflow.genai.delete_prompt_alias(name="<prompt_name>", alias="<alias_name>")`: Deletes an alias. (The prompt version itself remains).
- `mlflow.genai.load_prompt(name_or_uri=""prompts:/<prompt_name>@<alias_name>"")`: Retrieves the prompt version details that an alias currently points to.

## Governance and Maintenance

As the number of prompts and their versions grow, establishing governance policies becomes important.

- **Alias Naming Conventions**: Define clear and consistent naming conventions for aliases (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, `prod-emea`, `prod-apac`, `archive-<date>`).
- **Promotion Process**: Document the process and criteria for promoting a prompt version from one lifecycle stage (alias) to the next. This might involve reviews, automated test results, and approvals.
- **Access Control**: Control who can create/update/delete prompts and aliases. MLflow's access control mechanisms (especially in managed deployments like Databricks) can be used to enforce these permissions. For open-source MLflow, this often relies on controlling access to the MLflow tracking server.

## Archiving and Deprecating Prompts

Not all prompt versions will be useful indefinitely.

- **Archiving with Aliases**: You can use aliases like `archived_v1` or `deprecated_2023` to signify that a version is no longer in active use but is kept for historical record.
- **Deleting Specific Prompt Versions**: If a prompt version is deemed unnecessary or problematic and should not be used at all (even by accident), you can delete specific versions using `mlflow.delete_prompt()` through the Python SDK. _Use this with caution, as version deletion is a permanent action and might break lineage if not managed carefully._

  ```python
  # Delete a prompt
  mlflow.delete_prompt(name=prompt_name, version=version_to_delete)
  ```

  Generally, you cannot delete a prompt version that an alias currently points to. You would need to move or delete the alias first.

## Key Takeaways

- Aliases are fundamental for managing prompt lifecycles (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`).
- MLflow provides UI and SDK (`MlflowClient`) capabilities for creating, updating, and deleting aliases.
- Establishing governance policies for alias management, promotion processes, and access control is crucial for maintainability.
- Use aliases for archiving and be cautious with the permanent deletion of specific prompt versions (`mlflow.delete_prompt()`).

## Prerequisites

- An established MLflow Prompt Registry with multiple prompts and versions.
- Familiarity with the concept of aliases from previous pages.
- (For SDK examples) MLflow Python client installed and configured.

Effective use of aliases for lifecycle management ensures that your team can confidently develop, test, and deploy prompts while maintaining control and visibility across all stages.
