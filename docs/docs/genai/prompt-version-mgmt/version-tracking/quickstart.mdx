# GenAI Agent Quickstart

Build and evaluate a LangChain-based chatbot with MLflow's comprehensive tracking and evaluation capabilities. This quickstart demonstrates prompt engineering, trace generation, and performance assessment using MLflow 3's GenAI features.

## Prerequisites

### Install Required Packages

:::note MLflow 3 Required
This quickstart requires MLflow version 3.0 or higher for full GenAI functionality.
:::

```bash
pip install --upgrade mlflow
pip install langchain-openai
```

### Set OpenAI API Key

Configure your OpenAI API key to authenticate with OpenAI services:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Overview

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to:
- Register and version control prompt templates
- Create a LangChain-based conversational agent
- Enable automatic trace logging for debugging
- Evaluate model performance with custom metrics

Let's build a simple IT support chatbot and track its development lifecycle with MLflow.

## Step 1: Register a Prompt Template

Start by creating a versioned prompt template. This enables you to track prompt evolution and ensure reproducibility across experiments.

```python
import mlflow

system_prompt = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(
    name="chatbot_prompt",
    template="You are a chatbot that can answer questions about IT. Answer this question: {{question}}",
    commit_message="Initial version of chatbot",
)
```

### View Your Prompt in MLflow UI

Navigate to the **Prompts** tab to see your registered prompt:

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  ![The MLflow UI showing a prompt
  version](/images/mlflow-3/genai/chatbot_prompt.png)
</div>

## Step 2: Build a LangChain Conversational Chain

Create a simple chain that combines your prompt template with OpenAI's chat model:

```python
from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Convert MLflow prompt to LangChain format
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(system_prompt.to_single_brace_format())

# Build the chain: prompt → LLM → output parser
chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7) | StrOutputParser()

# Test the chain
question = "What is MLflow?"
print(chain.invoke({"question": question}))
# MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle...
```

## Step 3: Enable Trace Observability

Set up automatic trace logging to monitor your model's behavior during development. This creates a linked history of all model interactions.

### Configure Active Model and Autologging

```python
# Set the active model for linking traces
mlflow.set_active_model(name="langchain_model")

# Enable autologging - all traces will be automatically linked to the active model
mlflow.langchain.autolog()
```

### Generate Test Traces

Run multiple queries to generate traces for analysis:

```python
questions = [
    {"question": "What is MLflow Tracking and how does it work?"},
    {"question": "What is Unity Catalog?"},
    {"question": "What are user-defined functions (UDFs)?"},
]
outputs = []

for question in questions:
    outputs.append(chain.invoke(question))

# Verify traces are linked to the active model
active_model_id = mlflow.get_active_model_id()
mlflow.search_traces(model_id=active_model_id)
```

### Explore Traces in the UI

1. **View the Logged Model**: Check the **Models** tab in your experiment:

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  ![The MLflow UI showing the logged models in an
  experiment](/images/mlflow-3/genai/logged_models_tab.png)
</div>

2. **Access Model Details**: Click on your model to view its unique `model_id`:

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  ![The MLflow UI showing the logged model details
  page](/images/mlflow-3/genai/logged_model_page.png)
</div>

3. **Analyze Generated Traces**: Navigate to the **Traces** tab to examine individual interactions:

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  ![The MLflow UI showing the logged model autolog traces
  lineage](/images/mlflow-3/genai/logged_model_autolog_traces.png)
</div>

## Step 4: Evaluate Model Performance

Use MLflow's evaluation framework to assess your chatbot's accuracy and relevance against expected responses.

### Run Evaluation with Custom Metrics

Evaluate your model using GenAI-specific metrics:

```python
eval_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": questions,
        "expected_response": [
            """MLflow Tracking is a key component of the MLflow platform designed to record and manage machine learning experiments. It enables data scientists and engineers to log parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts in a systematic way, facilitating experiment tracking and reproducibility.

How It Works:

At the heart of MLflow Tracking is the concept of a run, which is an execution of a machine learning code. Each run can log the following:

Parameters: Input variables or hyperparameters used in the model (e.g., learning rate, number of trees). Metrics: Quantitative measures to evaluate the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, loss). Artifacts: Output files like models, datasets, or images generated during the run. Source Code: The version of the code or Git commit hash used. These logs are stored in a tracking server, which can be set up locally or on a remote server. The tracking server uses a backend storage (like a database or file system) to keep a record of all runs and their associated data.

Users interact with MLflow Tracking through its APIs available in multiple languages (Python, R, Java, etc.). By invoking these APIs in the code, you can start and end runs, and log data as the experiment progresses. Additionally, MLflow offers autologging capabilities for popular machine learning libraries, automatically capturing relevant parameters and metrics without manual code changes.

The logged data can be visualized using the MLflow UI, a web-based interface that displays all experiments and runs. This UI allows you to compare runs side-by-side, filter results, and analyze performance metrics over time. It aids in identifying the best models and understanding the impact of different parameters.

By providing a structured way to record experiments, MLflow Tracking enhances collaboration among team members, ensures transparency, and makes it easier to reproduce results. It integrates seamlessly with other MLflow components like Projects and Model Registry, offering a comprehensive solution for managing the machine learning lifecycle.""",
            """Unity Catalog is a feature in Databricks that allows you to create a centralized inventory of your data assets, such as tables, views, and functions, and share them across different teams and projects. It enables easy discovery, collaboration, and reuse of data assets within your organization.

With Unity Catalog, you can:

1. Create a single source of truth for your data assets: Unity Catalog acts as a central repository of all your data assets, making it easier to find and access the data you need.
2. Improve collaboration: By providing a shared inventory of data assets, Unity Catalog enables data scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders to collaborate more effectively.
3. Foster reuse of data assets: Unity Catalog encourages the reuse of existing data assets, reducing the need to create new assets from scratch and improving overall efficiency.
4. Enhance data governance: Unity Catalog provides a clear view of data assets, enabling better data governance and compliance.

Unity Catalog is particularly useful in large organizations where data is scattered across different teams, projects, and environments. It helps create a unified view of data assets, making it easier to work with data across different teams and projects.""",
            """User-defined functions (UDFs) in the context of Databricks and Apache Spark are custom functions that you can create to perform specific tasks on your data. These functions are written in a programming language such as Python, Java, Scala, or SQL, and can be used to extend the built-in functionality of Spark.

UDFs can be used to perform complex data transformations, data cleaning, or to apply custom business logic to your data. Once defined, UDFs can be invoked in SQL queries or in DataFrame transformations, allowing you to reuse your custom logic across multiple queries and applications.

To use UDFs in Databricks, you first need to define them in a supported programming language, and then register them with the SparkSession. Once registered, UDFs can be used in SQL queries or DataFrame transformations like any other built-in function.""",
        ],
        "outputs": outputs,
    }
