# Package code for Databricks Model Serving

While the previous guide showed how to track application versions using `LoggedModel` as a metadata hub linking to external code (e.g., Git), there are scenarios where you need to package your application code directly into the `LoggedModel`. This is particularly useful for deployment to [Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/machine-learning/model-serving/create-manage-serving-endpoints), which expects self-contained model artifacts.

## When to Package Code Directly

Package your code into a `LoggedModel` when you need:

- **Self-contained deployment artifacts** that include all code and dependencies
- **Direct deployment to serving platforms** without external code dependencies

This is an **optional step for deployment**, not the default versioning approach for development iterations.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires the following packages:

- **mlflow[databricks]>=3.1**: Core MLflow functionality with GenAI features and Databricks connectivity. MLflow 2.x is not supported as it lacks the version tracking features with `LoggedModel`.
- **langchain-openai>=0.3.10**: LangChain OpenAI integration, which automatically installs langchain-core and openai as dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "mlflow[databricks]>=3.1" "langchain-openai>=0.3.10"
```

:::tip
**Running in a Databricks notebook?** MLflow is pre-installed in the Databricks runtime. You only need to install:

```bash
%pip install langchain-openai
```

**Running locally?** You'll need to install both packages listed above.
:::

## Environment Setup

Before running the examples below, configure your environment:

### Configure Databricks Authentication

:::note
If you're running this code **inside a Databricks notebook**, you can skip this authentication setup. MLflow will automatically use your notebook's authentication context.
:::

If you're running this code **outside of Databricks** (e.g., in your local IDE), you need to set up authentication:

```python
import os

# Set Databricks authentication (only needed when running outside Databricks)
os.environ[
    "DATABRICKS_HOST"
] = "https://your-workspace.databricks.com"  # Your workspace URL
os.environ["DATABRICKS_TOKEN"] = "your-databricks-token"  # Your access token
```

### Configure API Keys

Set your LLM provider API keys as environment variables:

```python
import os

# Set your OpenAI API key (required for the LangChain examples)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
```

:::tip
You can also set these environment variables in your shell before running your script:

```bash
# For Databricks authentication (if running outside Databricks)
export DATABRICKS_HOST="https://your-workspace.databricks.com"
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="your-databricks-token"

# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

:::

### Configure MLflow Tracking and Model Registry

Set up MLflow to connect to your tracking server and experiment:

```python
import mlflow

# Set MLflow tracking URI and experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")
mlflow.set_registry_uri("databricks-uc")
mlflow.set_experiment("/Shared/my_genai_app_deployment")
```

## Using Code Packaging for LoggedModels with LangChain

MLflow's [Models From Code](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/models-from-code/) feature lets you define your model as a Python script rather than serializing objects. This avoids common serialization issues and creates more portable, readable model definitions.

### Step 1: Define Your LangChain App as a Script

Create a Python file (e.g., `landscape_chain.py`) that defines your LangChain application:

```python
import mlflow
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from operator import itemgetter


# Helper functions to extract data with defaults
def get_region(input_data):
    default = "North America"
    if isinstance(input_data[0], dict):
        return input_data[0].get("content", {}).get("region", default)
    return default


def get_area(input_data):
    default = "5000 square feet"
    if isinstance(input_data[0], dict):
        return input_data[0].get("content", {}).get("area", default)
    return default


# Define the prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""You are a landscape designer providing suggestions for a {region} property.
    The area is {area}. Recommend native plants and materials suitable for the region.""",
    input_variables=["region", "area"],
)

# Create the LangChain LCEL chain
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.7)

chain = (
    {
        "region": itemgetter("messages") | RunnableLambda(get_region),
        "area": itemgetter("messages") | RunnableLambda(get_area),
    }
    | prompt
    | model
    | StrOutputParser()
)

# IMPORTANT: Set this chain as the model
mlflow.models.set_model(chain)
```

The key points:

- Define your complete chain logic in the script
- Use `mlflow.models.set_model(chain)` to designate what should be served
- The script is saved as plain text (human-readable) in the model artifacts

### Step 2: Log the Model for Deployment

```python
import mlflow

# Path to your chain definition script
chain_path = "./landscape_chain.py"

# Example input for the model signature
input_example = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": {"region": "Austin, TX, USA", "area": "2000 square feet"},
        }
    ]
}

info = mlflow.langchain.log_model(
    lc_model=chain_path,  # Path to the script, not an object
    input_example=input_example,
    # Register the model in Unity Catalog
    # (required for deployment on Databricks)
    registered_model_name="main.genai_apps.landscape_design_app",
    params={"git_commit": "abc123def", "deployment_target": "databricks-model-serving"},
)

print(f"Model logged with URI: {info.model_uri}")
print(f"Model registered as: main.genai_apps.landscape_design_app")

# Verify the LoggedModel was created
logged_model = mlflow.get_logged_model(info.model_id)
print(f"\nLoggedModel created:")
print(f"  Name: {logged_model.name}")
print(f"  Model ID: {logged_model.model_id}")
print(f"  Params: {logged_model.params}")
```

:::note
The `registered_model_name` parameter registers your model in Unity Catalog, making it available for deployment to Databricks Model Serving. Use the 3-level naming format: `catalog.schema.model_name`.
:::

### Step 3: Deploy to Databricks Model Serving

The logged model is now ready for deployment. It contains:

- Your chain definition script (`landscape_chain.py`)
- All required dependencies (automatically inferred from imports)
- The model signature and input example
- An `MLmodel` file describing how to load and run it

This self-contained package can be deployed directly to Databricks Model Serving without additional code setup.

To deploy your packaged model, see the [Create custom model serving endpoints](/machine-learning/model-serving/create-manage-serving-endpoints) guide for detailed instructions on setting up your serving endpoint.
