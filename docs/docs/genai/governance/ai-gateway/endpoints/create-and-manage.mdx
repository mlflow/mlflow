# Create and Manage Endpoints

Endpoints define how requests are routed to AI models. Each endpoint can use a single model or leverage advanced routing features like traffic splitting and fallbacks.

## Accessing Endpoints

Navigate to the AI Gateway section at `http://localhost:5000/#/gateway`. The Endpoints tab shows all your configured endpoints.

## Creating an Endpoint

### Basic Setup

1. Click **Create Endpoint**
2. Enter a unique endpoint name (e.g., `my-chat-endpoint`)
   - This name becomes part of your API path: `/gateway/my-chat-endpoint/...`
3. Select your provider from 100+ supported options
   - Common providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) appear first
   - Click "View all providers" for the full LiteLLM catalog
4. Choose your model
   - The selector displays capability badges (Tools, Reasoning, Caching)
   - Context window size and token costs are shown
   - Use the search function for quick filtering
5. Configure API key:
   - **Create new API key**: Configure credentials inline (convenient for first-time setup)
   - **Use existing API key**: Select from previously created keys (recommended for consistency)
6. Review your configuration in the summary panel
7. Click **Create Endpoint**

### Advanced Routing Options

For endpoints that need traffic splitting or fallbacks, see [Traffic Routing & Fallbacks](/genai/governance/ai-gateway/traffic-routing-fallbacks).

## Managing Existing Endpoints

### Viewing Endpoint Details

Click on any endpoint name to view its configuration:

- **Provider and model**: The currently configured model
- **API key**: Which credentials are being used
- **Traffic split**: Percentage distribution across models (if configured)
- **Fallbacks**: Ordered list of fallback models (if configured)

### Editing Endpoints

To modify an endpoint:

1. Click on the endpoint name to open details
2. Update the configuration as needed:
   - Change the model
   - Switch API keys
   - Add or modify traffic splitting
   - Configure fallbacks
3. Changes take effect immediately with zero downtime

### Deleting Endpoints

1. Locate the endpoint in the list
2. Click the delete action
3. Confirm deletion

:::warning
Deleting an endpoint immediately removes it from service. Any applications using that endpoint will receive errors.

## Zero-Downtime Updates

The AI Gateway supports dynamic configuration updates. You can:

- Add new endpoints without restarting the server
- Modify existing endpoint configurations
- Change API keys and credentials
- Adjust traffic splitting percentages
- Reorder fallback chains

All changes take effect immediately without disrupting running applications or requiring server restarts.
