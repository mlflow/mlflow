# Gateway Server (Legacy)

import TilesGrid from "@site/src/components/TilesGrid";

The Gateway Server provides a YAML-based configuration approach for deploying and managing LLM endpoints. This legacy method offers flexibility for users who prefer file-based configuration and command-line server management.

:::note
For new deployments, we recommend using the [Gateway Guide](../setup) which provides a modern web interface for managing endpoints, API keys, and routing configurations with zero-downtime updates.

## Supported Providers

The Gateway Server supports a comprehensive range of LLM providers through YAML configuration:

## Core Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you effectively configure the Gateway Server:

### Endpoints

Endpoints are named configurations defined in YAML that specify how to access a specific model from a provider. Each endpoint includes the model name, provider settings, and authentication parameters. Endpoints are configured in your YAML file and loaded when the server starts.

### Providers

Providers are the underlying LLM services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) that serve the models. Each provider requires specific configuration parameters and authentication credentials, which you define in the endpoint configuration.

### Routes

Routes provide advanced request routing capabilities, allowing you to define traffic splitting and fallback strategies across multiple endpoints. Routes are configured in the YAML file under the `routes` section and enable load balancing and high availability patterns.

### Configuration Management

The Gateway Server uses YAML files for all configuration. To update endpoints or routes, you modify the YAML file and restart the server. This approach provides version control and declarative configuration benefits, though it requires server restarts for changes to take effect.
