# Encryption & Rotation

This page covers API key security, including encryption configuration and credential rotation best practices.

## Encryption and Security

### Default Encryption

API keys are encrypted before being stored in the MLflow backend database. For local development, MLflow uses a default passphrase if none is configured. This is acceptable for development or single-user deployments.

### Production Encryption Setup

For production environments, configure a custom encryption passphrase:

```bash
# Generate a secure passphrase
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Set the passphrase as an environment variable before starting the server
export MLFLOW_CRYPTO_KEK_PASSPHRASE="your-secure-passphrase-here"

# Start the MLflow server
mlflow server --port 5000
```

:::note
File-based tracking stores are not supported by the AI Gateway. The gateway requires a SQL-based backend store (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MSSQL).

## Rotating Provider API Keys

When you need to rotate credentials from your LLM provider for security purposes:

### Simple Rotation (Zero-Downtime)

This approach updates credentials in place with no service interruption:

1. Navigate to the **API Keys** tab in the Gateway UI
2. Locate the key you want to rotate
3. Click the **Edit** button
4. Update the credential value with your new API key from the provider
5. Click **Save**

All endpoints using this API key will automatically use the new credentials without requiring any configuration changes or server restarts.

### Advanced Rotation (With Rollback Capability)

For mission-critical deployments where you want a rollback path:

1. **Create a new API key** with the rotated credentials (e.g., `my-openai-key-v2`)
2. **Update your endpoints** to use the new API key
3. **Monitor your endpoints** to ensure they're working correctly
4. **Delete the old API key** once you've verified the rotation was successful

This approach allows you to quickly revert to the old key if issues arise.

## Rotating the Encryption Passphrase

The encryption passphrase is the master secret used to encrypt all stored API keys in the database. You should rotate this periodically for security best practices.

### Prerequisites

- Direct database access
- Ability to stop the MLflow server
- Current KEK passphrase and version

### Rotation Process

1. **Stop the MLflow server** to ensure atomicity:

   ```bash
   # Example: systemctl stop mlflow-server
   ```

2. **Set current environment variables** (if not already configured):

   ```bash
   export MLFLOW_CRYPTO_KEK_PASSPHRASE="current-passphrase"
   export MLFLOW_CRYPTO_KEK_VERSION="1"  # Current version
   export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="database url"
   ```

3. **Run the rotation command** with your new passphrase:

   ```bash
   mlflow crypto rotate-kek --new-passphrase "new-passphrase"
   ```

   The command will re-wrap all encryption keys with the new KEK. The API key values themselves are not re-encrypted, making this efficient even with many secrets.

4. **Update deployment configuration** with BOTH new values:

   ```bash
   export MLFLOW_CRYPTO_KEK_PASSPHRASE="new-passphrase"
   export MLFLOW_CRYPTO_KEK_VERSION="2"  # Incremented version
   ```

5. **Restart the MLflow server** with the updated configuration.

:::warning
You must update BOTH `MLFLOW_CRYPTO_KEK_PASSPHRASE` and `MLFLOW_CRYPTO_KEK_VERSION` environment variables. Failure to update both will cause decryption failures when the server attempts to read stored API keys.
