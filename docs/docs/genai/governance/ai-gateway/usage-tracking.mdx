# Usage Tracking

AI Gateway usage tracking logs all requests to an endpoint as traces in an MLflow experiment linked to your gateway endpoints, allowing you to monitor request volume, latency, errors, token consumption, and costs.

## Enabling Usage Tracking

Open your endpoint's detail page and scroll to the **Usage Tracking** section at the bottom.

1. Toggle **Enable usage tracking** on
2. Optionally select an existing experiment, or leave blank to auto-create one named `gateway/<endpoint_name>`
3. Click **Save changes**

## Usage Dashboard

Navigate to **AI Gateway > Usage** in the sidebar, or click the **Usage** tab on an endpoint's detail page.

The dashboard provides the following charts:

- **Requests** — Total request count over time with daily/hourly averages
- **Latency** — Response time distribution (p50, p90, p99)
- **Errors** — Error rate and error count breakdown
- **Token Usage** — Input and output tokens over time
- **Tokens per Request** — Average token consumption per request
- **Cost Breakdown** — Cost distribution by model or provider
- **Cost Over Time** — Cumulative cost trends

### Filtering

Use the controls at the top of the dashboard to:

- **Endpoint** — View all endpoints or filter to a specific one
- **Time Unit** — Aggregate by hour, day, or week
- **Time Range** — Select a preset range (last 7 days, 30 days, etc.) or a custom range

### Per-Endpoint Usage

Each endpoint's detail page also has a **Usage** tab that shows the same charts scoped to that endpoint, with a **View full dashboard** link to the main Usage page.
