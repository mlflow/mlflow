# Prompt Engineering UI (Experimental)

Starting in MLflow 2.7, the MLflow Tracking UI provides a best-in-class experience for prompt
engineering. With no code required, you can try out multiple LLMs from the
[MLflow AI Gateway](/genai/governance/ai-gateway), parameter configurations, and prompts to build a variety of models for
question answering, document summarization, and beyond. Using the embedded Evaluation UI, you can
also evaluate multiple models on a set of inputs and compare the responses to select the best one.
Every model created with the prompt engineering UI is stored in the [MLflow Model](/ml/model)
format and can be deployed for batch or real time inference. All configurations (prompt templates,
choice of LLM, parameters, etc.) are tracked as [MLflow Runs](/ml/tracking).

## Quickstart \{#prompt-engineering-quickstart}

The following guide will get you started with MLflow's UI for prompt engineering.

### Step 1: Create an MLflow AI Gateway Completions or Chat Endpoint

To use the prompt engineering UI, you need to create one or more [MLflow AI Gateway](/genai/governance/ai-gateway)
completions or chat endpoints. Follow the
[MLflow AI Gateway Quickstart guide](/genai/governance/ai-gateway/guides/step1-create-deployments) to easily create an endpoint in less than five
minutes. If you already have access to an MLflow AI Gateway endpoint of type `llm/v1/completions`
or `llm/v1/chat`, you can skip this step.

```bash
mlflow gateway start --config-path config.yaml --port 7000
```

### Step 2: Connect the MLflow AI Gateway to your MLflow Tracking Server

The prompt engineering UI also requires a connection between the MLflow AI Gateway and the MLflow
Tracking Server. To connect the MLflow AI Gateway with the MLflow Tracking Server, simply set the
`MLFLOW_DEPLOYMENTS_TARGET` environment variable in the environment where the server is running and
restart the server. For example, if the MLflow AI Gateway is running at `http://localhost:7000`, you
can start an MLflow Tracking Server in a shell on your local machine and connect it to the
MLflow AI Gateway using the <APILink fn="mlflow.server.cli" hash="mlflow-server">mlflow server</APILink> command as follows:

```bash
export MLFLOW_DEPLOYMENTS_TARGET="http://127.0.0.1:7000"
mlflow server --port 5000
```

### Step 3: Create or find an MLflow Experiment

Next, open an existing MLflow Experiment in the MLflow UI, or create a new experiment.

<div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 650, width: "100%" }}>
  ![](/images/experiment_page.png)
</div>

### Step 4: Create a run with prompt engineering

Once you have opened the Experiment, click the **New Run** button and select
_using Prompt Engineering_. This will open the prompt engineering playground where you can try
out different LLMs, parameters, and prompts.

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <div style={{ width: "25%" }}>![](/images/new_run.png)</div>
  <div style={{ width: "70%" }}>![](/images/prompt_modal_1.png)</div>
</div>

### Step 5: Select your endpoint and evaluate the example prompt

Next, click the _Select endpoint_ dropdown and select the MLflow AI Gateway completions endpoint you created in
Step 1. Then, click the **Evaluate** button to test out an example prompt engineering use case
for generating product advertisements.

MLflow will embed the specified _stock_type_ input
variable value - `"books"` - into the specified _prompt template_ and send it to the LLM
associated with the MLflow AI Gateway endpoint with the configured _temperature_ (currently `0.01`)
and _max_tokens_ (currently 1000). The LLM response will appear in the _Output_ section.

![](/images/prompt_modal_2.png)

### Step 6: Try a prompt of your choosing

Replace the prompt template from the previous step with a prompt template of your choosing.
Prompts can define multiple variables. For example, you can use the following prompt template
to instruct the LLM to answer questions about the MLflow documentation:

````
Read the following article from the MLflow documentation that appears between triple
backticks. Then, answer the question about the documentation that appears between triple quotes.
Include relevant links and code examples in your answer.

```{{article}}```

"""
{{question}}
"""
````

Then, fill in the input variables. For example, in the MLflow documentation
use case, the _article_ input variable can be set to the contents of
https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#logging-data-to-runs and the _question_ input variable
can be set to `"How do I create a new MLflow Run using the Python API?"`.

Finally, click the **Evaluate** button to see the new output. You can also try choosing a larger
value of _temperature_ to observe how the LLM's output changes.

<div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 820, width: "100%" }}>
  ![](/images/prompt_modal_3.png)
</div>

### Step 7: Capture your choice of LLM, prompt template, and parameters as an MLflow Run

Once you're satisfied with your chosen prompt template and parameters, click the **Create Run**
button to store this information, along with your choice of LLM, as an MLflow Run. This will
create a new Run with the prompt template, parameters, and choice of LLM stored as Run params.
It will also automatically create an MLflow Model with this information that can be used for batch
or real-time inference.

1.  To view this information, click the Run name to open the **Run** page:

    <div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 750, width: "100%" }}>![](/images/prompt_eng_run_page.png)</div>

2.  You can also see the parameters and compare them with other configurations by opening the **Table**
    view tab:

          <div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 750, width: "100%" }}>

    ![](/images/prompt_eng_table_view.png)

    </div>

3.  After your Run is created, MLflow will open the **Evaluation** tab where you can see your latest
    playground input & output and try out additional inputs:

          <div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 750, width: "100%" }}>

    ![](/images/eval_view_1.png)

    </div>

### Step 8: Try new inputs

To test the behavior of your chosen LLM, prompt template, and parameters on a new inputs:

1. Click the _Add Row_ button and fill in a value(s) your prompt template's input variable(s).
   For example, in the MLflow documentation use case, you can try asking a question
   unrelated to MLflow to see how the LLM responds. This is important to ensure that the application
   is robust to irrelevant inputs.

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <div style={{ width: "10%" }}>![](/images/add_row.png)</div>
  <div style={{ width: "50%" }}>![](/images/add_row_modal.png)</div>
</div>

2.  Then, click the **Evaluate** button to see the output.

          <div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 650, width: "100%" }}>

    ![](/images/evaluate_new_input.png)

    </div>

3.  Finally, click the **Save** button to store the new inputs and output.

          <div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 650, width: "100%" }}>

    ![](/images/save_new_input.png)

    </div>

### Step 9: Adjust your prompt template and create a new Run

As you try additional inputs, you might discover scenarios where your choice of LLM, prompt
template, and parameters doesn't perform as well as you would like. For example, in the
MLflow documentation use case, the LLM still attempts to answer irrelevant
questions about [MLflow Projects](/ml/projects) even if the answer does not appear in the
specified article.

1.  To improve performance, create a new Run by selecting the _Duplicate run_ option from the context
    menu. For example, in the MLflow documentation use case, adding the following text to
    the prompt template helps improve robustness to irrelevant questions:

    ```
    If the question does not relate to the article, respond exactly with the phrase
    "I do not know how to answer that question." Do not include any additional text in your
    response.
    ```

          <div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 500, width: "100%" }}>

    ![](/images/duplicate_run.png)

    </div>

2.  Then, from the prompt engineering playground, adjust the prompt template (and / or choice of
    LLM and parameters), evaluate an input, and click the **Create Run** button to create a new Run.

    ![](/images/prompt_modal_4.png)

### Step 10: Evaluate the new prompt template on previous inputs

Now that you've made an adjustment to your prompt template, it's important to make sure that
the new template performs well on the previous inputs and compare the outputs with older
configurations.

1.  From the **Evaluation** tab, click the **Evaluate all** button next to the new Run to evaluate
    all of the previous inputs.

          <div className="center-div" style={{ maxWidth: 300, width: "100%" }}>

    ![](/images/evaluate_all.png)

    </div>

2.  Click the **Save** button to store the results.

    ![](/images/evaluate_all_results.png)

### Step 11: Load evaluation data programmatically

All of the inputs and outputs produced by the MLflow prompt engineering UI and Evaluation UI are stored
as artifacts in MLflow Runs. They can be accessed programmatically using the <APILink fn="mlflow.load_table" /> API
as follows:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_experiment("/Path/to/your/prompt/engineering/experiment")

# Load input and output data across all Runs (configurations) as a Pandas DataFrame
inputs_outputs_pdf = mlflow.load_table(
    # All inputs and outputs created from the MLflow UI are stored in an artifact called
    # "eval_results_table.json"
    artifact_file="eval_results_table.json",
    # Include the run ID as a column in the table to distinguish inputs and outputs
    # produced by different runs
    extra_columns=["run_id"],
)
# Optionally convert the Pandas DataFrame to Spark where it can be stored as a Delta
# table or joined with existing Delta tables
inputs_outputs_sdf = spark.createDataFrame(inputs_outputs_pdf)
```

### Step 12: Generate predictions programmatically \{#quickstart-score}

Once you have found a configuration of LLM, prompt template, and parameters that performs well, you
can generate predictions using the corresponding MLflow Model in a Python environment of your choosing,
or you can [deploy it for real-time serving](#deploy-prompt-serving).

1. To load the MLflow Model in a notebook for batch inference, click on the Run's name to open the
   **Run Page** and select the _model_ directory in the **Artifact Viewer**. Then, copy the first
   few lines of code from the _Predict on a Pandas DataFrame_ section and run them in a Python
   environment of your choosing, for example:

   ![](/images/load_model.png)

   ```python
   import mlflow

   logged_model = "runs:/8451075c46964f82b85fe16c3d2b7ea0/model"

   # Load model as a PyFuncModel.
   loaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(logged_model)
   ```

2. Then, to generate predictions, call the <APILink fn="mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel.predict">`predict()`</APILink> method
   and pass in a dictionary of input variables. For example:

   ```python
   article_text = """
   An MLflow Project is a format for packaging data science code in a reusable and reproducible way.
   The MLflow Projects component includes an API and command-line tools for running projects, which
   also integrate with the Tracking component to automatically record the parameters and git commit
   of your source code for reproducibility.

   This article describes the format of an MLflow Project and how to run an MLflow project remotely
   using the MLflow CLI, which makes it easy to vertically scale your data science code.
   """
   question = "What is an MLflow project?"

   loaded_model.predict({"article": article_text, "question": question})
   ```

   For more information about deployment for real-time serving with MLflow,
   see the [instructions below](#deploy-prompt-serving).

## Deployment for real-time serving \{#deploy-prompt-serving}

Once you have found a configuration of LLM, prompt template, and parameters that performs well, you
can deploy the corresponding MLflow Model for real-time serving as follows:

1. Register your model with the MLflow Model Registry. The following example registers
   an MLflow Model created from the [Quickstart](#quickstart-score) as Version 1 of the
   Registered Model named `"mlflow_docs_qa_model"`.

   ```python
   mlflow.register_model(
       model_uri="runs:/8451075c46964f82b85fe16c3d2b7ea0/model",
       name="mlflow_docs_qa_model",
   )
   ```

2. Define the following environment variables in the environment where you will run your
   MLflow Model Server, such as a shell on your local machine:
   - `MLFLOW_DEPLOYMENTS_TARGET`: The URL of the MLflow AI Gateway

3. Use the <APILink fn="mlflow.server.cli" hash="mlflow-models-serve">mlflow models serve</APILink> command to start the MLflow Model Server. For example,
   running the following command from a shell on your local machine will serve the model
   on port 8000:

   ```bash
   mlflow models serve --model-uri models:/mlflow_docs_qa_model/1 --port 8000
   ```

4. Once the server has been started, it can be queried via REST API call. For example:

   ```bash
   input='
   {
       "dataframe_records": [
           {
               "article": "An MLflow Project is a format for packaging data science code...",
               "question": "What is an MLflow Project?"
           }
       ]
   }'

   echo $input | curl \
     -s \
     -X POST \
     https://localhost:8000/invocations
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d @-
   ```

   where `article` and `question` are replaced with the input variable(s) from your
   prompt template.
