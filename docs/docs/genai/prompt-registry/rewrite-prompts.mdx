# Auto-rewrite Prompts for New Models (Experimental)

When migrating to a new language model, you often discover that your carefully crafted prompts don't work as well with the new model. MLflow's <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.optimize_prompts" /> API helps you **automatically rewrite prompts** to maintain output quality when switching models, using your existing application's outputs as training data.

:::tip Key Benefits

- **Model Migration**: Seamlessly switch between language models while maintaining output consistency
- **Automatic Optimization**: Automatically rewrites prompts based on your existing data
- **No Ground Truth Requirement**: No human labeling is required if you optimize prompts based on the existing outputs
- **Trace-Aware**: Leverages MLflow tracing to understand prompt usage patterns
- **Flexible**: Works with any function that uses MLflow Prompt Registry

:::

:::note[Version Requirements]
The `optimize_prompts` API requires **MLflow >= 3.5.0**.

### Example: Simple Prompt ‚Üí Optimized Prompt

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Before Optimization:**

```text
Classify the sentiment. Answer 'positive'
or 'negative' or 'neutral'.

Text: {{text}}
```

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**After Optimization:**

```text
Classify the sentiment of the provided text.
Your response must be one of the following:
- 'positive'
- 'negative'
- 'neutral'

Ensure your response is lowercase and contains
only one of these three words.

Text: {{text}}

Guidelines:
- 'positive': The text expresses satisfaction,
  happiness, or approval
- 'negative': The text expresses dissatisfaction,
  anger, or disapproval
- 'neutral': The text is factual or balanced
  without strong emotion

Your response must match this exact format with
no additional explanation.

## When to Use Prompt Rewriting

This approach is ideal when:

- **Downgrading Models**: Moving from `gpt-5` ‚Üí `gpt-4o-mini` to reduce costs
- **Switching Providers**: Changing from OpenAI to Anthropic or vice versa
- **Performance Optimization**: Moving to faster models while maintaining quality
- **You Have Existing Outputs**: Your current system already produces good results

## Quick Start: Model Migration Workflow

Here's a complete example of migrating from `gpt-5` to `gpt-4o-mini` while maintaining output consistency:

### Step 1: Capture Outputs from Original Model

First, collect outputs from your existing model using MLflow tracing:

```python
import mlflow
import openai
from mlflow.genai.optimize import GepaPromptOptimizer
from mlflow.genai.datasets import create_dataset
from mlflow.genai.scorers import Equivalence

# Register your current prompt
prompt = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(
    name="sentiment",
    template="""Classify the sentiment. Answer 'positive' or 'negative' or 'neutral'.
Text: {{text}}""",
)


# Define your prediction function using the original model and base prompt
@mlflow.trace
def predict_fn_base_model(text: str) -> str:
    completion = openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",  # Original model
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt.format(text=text)}],
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content.lower()


# Example inputs - each record contains an "inputs" dict with the function's input parameters
inputs = [
    {
        "inputs": {
            "text": "This movie was absolutely fantastic! I loved every minute of it."
        }
    },
    {"inputs": {"text": "The service was terrible and the food arrived cold."}},
    {"inputs": {"text": "It was okay, nothing special but not bad either."}},
    {
        "inputs": {
            "text": "I'm so disappointed with this purchase. Complete waste of money."
        }
    },
    {"inputs": {"text": "Best experience ever! Highly recommend to everyone."}},
    {"inputs": {"text": "The product works as described. No complaints."}},
    {"inputs": {"text": "I can't believe how amazing this turned out to be!"}},
    {"inputs": {"text": "Worst customer support I've ever dealt with."}},
    {"inputs": {"text": "It's fine for the price. Gets the job done."}},
    {"inputs": {"text": "This exceeded all my expectations. Truly wonderful!"}},
]

# Collect outputs from original model
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    for record in inputs:
        predict_fn_base_model(**record["inputs"])
```

### Step 2: Create Training Dataset from Traces

Convert the traced outputs into a training dataset:

```python
# Create dataset
dataset = create_dataset(name="sentiment_migration_dataset")

# Retrieve traces from the run
traces = mlflow.search_traces(return_type="list", run_id=run.info.run_id)

# Merge traces into dataset
dataset.merge_records(traces)
```

This automatically creates a dataset with:

- `inputs`: The input variables (`text` in this case)
- `outputs`: The actual outputs from your original model (`gpt-5`)

You can view the created dataset in the MLflow UI by navigating to:

1. **Experiments** tab ‚Üí Select your experiment
2. **Evaluations** tab ‚Üí Select the "Datasets" tab on the left sidebar
3. **Dataset** tab ‚Üí Inspect the input/output pairs

The dataset view shows all the inputs and outputs collected from your traces, making it easy to verify the training data before optimization.

### Step 3: Switch Model

Switch your LM to the target model:

```python
# Define function using target model
@mlflow.trace
def predict_fn(text: str) -> str:
    completion = openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Target model
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt.format(text=text)}],
        temperature=0,
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content.lower()
```

You might notice the target model doesn't follow the format as consistently as the original model.

### Step 4: Optimize Prompts for Target Model

Use the collected dataset to optimize prompts for the target model:

```python
# Optimize prompts for the target model
result = mlflow.genai.optimize_prompts(
    predict_fn=predict_fn,
    train_data=dataset,
    prompt_uris=[prompt.uri],
    optimizer=GepaPromptOptimizer(reflection_model="openai:/gpt-5"),
    scorers=[Equivalence(model="openai:/gpt-5")],
)

# View the optimized prompt
optimized_prompt = result.optimized_prompts[0]
print(f"Optimized template: {optimized_prompt.template}")
```

The optimized prompt will include additional instructions to help `gpt-4o-mini` match the behavior of `gpt-5`:

```
Optimized template:
Classify the sentiment of the provided text. Your response must be one of the following:
- 'positive'
- 'negative'
- 'neutral'

Ensure your response is lowercase and contains only one of these three words.

Text: {{text}}

Guidelines:
- 'positive': The text expresses satisfaction, happiness, or approval
- 'negative': The text expresses dissatisfaction, anger, or disapproval
- 'neutral': The text is factual or balanced without strong emotion

Your response must match this exact format with no additional explanation.
```

### Step 5: Use Optimized Prompt

Deploy the optimized prompt in your application:

```python
# Load the optimized prompt
optimized = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(optimized_prompt.uri)


# Use in production
@mlflow.trace
def predict_fn_optimized(text: str) -> str:
    completion = openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": optimized.format(text=text)}],
        temperature=0,
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content.lower()


# Test with new inputs
test_result = predict_fn_optimized("This product is amazing!")
print(test_result)  # Output: positive
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Collect Sufficient Data

For best results, collect outputs from at least 20-50 diverse examples:

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Diverse examples
inputs = [
    {"inputs": {"text": "Great product!"}},
    {
        "inputs": {
            "text": "The delivery was delayed by three days and the packaging was damaged. The product itself works fine but the experience was disappointing overall."
        }
    },
    {
        "inputs": {
            "text": "It meets the basic requirements. Nothing more, nothing less."
        }
    },
    # ... more varied examples
]

# ‚ùå Poor: Too few, too similar
inputs = [
    {"inputs": {"text": "Good"}},
    {"inputs": {"text": "Bad"}},
]
```

### 2. Use Representative Examples

Include edge cases and challenging inputs:

```python
inputs = [
    {"inputs": {"text": "Absolutely fantastic!"}},  # Clear positive
    {"inputs": {"text": "It's not bad, I guess."}},  # Ambiguous
    {"inputs": {"text": "The food was good but service terrible."}},  # Mixed sentiment
]
```

### 3. Verify Results

Always test optimized prompts using <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate" /> before production deployment.

```python
# Evaluate optimized prompt
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=test_dataset,
    predict_fn=predict_fn_optimized,
    scorers=[accuracy_scorer, format_scorer],
)

print(f"Accuracy: {results.metrics['accuracy']}")
print(f"Format compliance: {results.metrics['format_scorer']}")
```
