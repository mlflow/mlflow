    "In this notebook, we demonstrated the complete MemAlign workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Created an LLM judge for evaluating response helpfulness\n",
    "2. Prepared datasets with a tricky case: factually correct but emotionally cold responses\n",
    "3. Evaluated baseline performance - the judge incorrectly rated cold responses as helpful\n",
    "4. Aligned the judge using human feedback with MemAlign\n",
    "5. Inspected learned guidelines - MemAlign learned that empathy matters\n",
    "6. Evaluated improved performance - the aligned judge now considers emotional tone\n",
    "7. Unaligned specific traces - removed feedback from the judge's memory\n",
    "8. Registered the judge for use in future experiments\n",
    "# Key takeaways:\n",
    "- MemAlign captures nuance: It learned that factual correctness alone isn't enough\n",
    "- Dual memory system: Guidelines (semantic) + examples (episodic) provide robust alignment\n",
    "- Incremental updates: Use .align() to add feedback and .unalign() to remove it\n",
    "- Persistence: Register judges to share and reuse across experiments"
