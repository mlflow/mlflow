# MLflow Judges: Comprehensive Quality Assessment

Judges are specialized evaluation functions that assess specific quality dimensions of your GenAI applications. They provide focused, interpretable feedback on everything from safety and relevance to custom business requirements, forming the building blocks for comprehensive quality evaluation.

Think of judges as domain experts that examine your application's outputs through different lenses—each one bringing specialized knowledge to evaluate a particular aspect of quality with detailed explanations for their assessments.

## Why Use Judges?

**Specialized Expertise**: Each judge focuses on one quality dimension, bringing deep knowledge and nuanced understanding to specific evaluation challenges. This specialization ensures more accurate and reliable assessments than generic evaluation approaches.

**Transparent Decision-Making**: Judges provide not just scores but detailed rationales explaining their assessments. This transparency helps you understand quality issues and guides improvement efforts.

**Modular Design**: Combine different judges to create comprehensive evaluation suites tailored to your application's specific needs. Use safety judges for content moderation, relevance judges for query matching, and custom guidelines judges for business-specific requirements.

## Core Judge Categories

## Platform Capabilities

Understanding which judges are available on your platform helps you choose the right evaluation strategy:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="oss_platform" label="🌐 MLflow Open Source">

**Custom Judge Development**: MLflow OSS excels at custom judge creation using Python functions that implement your specific evaluation logic. This approach gives you complete control over assessment criteria and is ideal for deterministic quality checks.

**Heuristic-Based Evaluation**: Build judges using keyword matching, pattern recognition, length constraints, and other programmatic approaches. These judges are fast, cost-effective, and provide consistent results for well-defined criteria.

**External LLM Integration**: Create sophisticated judges by integrating with external LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or others. This enables semantic evaluation while maintaining platform flexibility.

```python
from mlflow.entities import Feedback


def custom_brand_voice_judge(response):
    """Custom judge for brand voice compliance."""
    professional_indicators = ["thank you", "please", "we appreciate"]
    informal_terms = ["hey", "awesome", "super cool"]

    response_lower = response.lower()
    professional_count = sum(
        1 for term in professional_indicators if term in response_lower
    )
    informal_count = sum(1 for term in informal_terms if term in response_lower)

    if professional_count > informal_count:
        return Feedback(value=1.0, rationale="Response maintains professional tone")
    else:
        return Feedback(value=0.0, rationale="Response uses informal language")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="databricks_platform" label="🏢 Databricks MLflow">

**Advanced Built-in Judges**: Databricks provides sophisticated, pre-built judges that understand semantic nuances and context. These judges leverage advanced LLM capabilities to provide human-like assessment quality.

**Natural Language Guidelines**: Define evaluation criteria using plain English descriptions rather than code. The system automatically interprets and applies these guidelines with sophisticated reasoning.

**Comprehensive RAG Support**: Specialized judges designed specifically for retrieval-augmented generation systems, including context relevance, grounding assessment, and retrieval quality evaluation.

```python
# Databricks built-in judges with advanced capabilities
from mlflow.genai.judges import (
    is_safe,  # Advanced safety assessment
    is_grounded,  # Sophisticated grounding evaluation
    is_correct,  # Nuanced correctness checking
    meets_guidelines,  # Natural language guideline interpretation
)

# Use with simple, natural language criteria
guidelines_result = meets_guidelines(
    guidelines=[
        "Maintain a helpful and professional tone",
        "Provide specific examples when explaining concepts",
        "Acknowledge if information is uncertain",
    ],
    context={"response": "Your application's response"},
)
```

**Note**: Databricks judges require the `databricks-agents` package and are optimized for the Databricks platform.

## Choosing the Right Judges

Selecting appropriate judges depends on your application type, quality requirements, and platform capabilities:

#### For Customer-Facing Applications
Start with safety judges to ensure appropriate content, add relevance judges to verify responses address user needs, and include guidelines judges to maintain brand consistency. Consider correctness judges if your application provides factual information.

#### For RAG and Knowledge Systems
Prioritize grounding judges to prevent hallucinations, use context sufficiency judges to validate retrieval quality, include correctness judges for factual accuracy, and add relevance judges to ensure responses stay on-topic.

#### For Compliance-Heavy Industries
Implement comprehensive guidelines judges for regulatory requirements, use safety judges for content appropriateness, add correctness judges for accuracy validation, and consider custom judges for industry-specific requirements.

#### For Creative and Conversational Applications
Focus on guidelines judges for brand voice and style, include safety judges for content appropriateness, use relevance judges to maintain conversation flow, and add custom judges for creativity or engagement metrics.

## Implementation Workflow

**1. Identify Quality Dimensions**: Determine which aspects of quality matter most for your application and users. Consider safety, accuracy, relevance, and any business-specific requirements.

**2. Select Core Judges**: Choose 3-5 judges that cover your most critical quality dimensions. Starting with a focused set helps establish baseline quality measurement without overwhelming complexity.

**3. Develop Evaluation Pipeline**: Integrate selected judges into your development and testing workflow. Use the same judges for both offline evaluation and production monitoring to maintain consistency.

**4. Iterate and Expand**: Based on initial results and operational experience, add additional judges or refine existing ones. Use production insights to guide judge selection and configuration.

```python
# Example comprehensive judge suite
evaluation_judges = [
    # Core safety and appropriateness
    is_safe,  # Content safety
    meets_guidelines,  # Brand compliance
    # Accuracy and reliability
    is_correct,  # Factual accuracy
    is_grounded,  # Source alignment
    # Relevance and utility
    is_context_relevant,  # Query addressing
    # Custom business logic
    custom_response_quality_judge,  # Domain-specific requirements
]

# Use in evaluation pipeline
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=your_test_dataset, predict_fn=your_application, scorers=evaluation_judges
)
```
