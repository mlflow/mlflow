# Prompt-based Judges

Prompt-based judges offer flexible, powerful evaluation by allowing you to define custom prompts and scoring schemas. Instead of pass/fail judgments, they enable multi-value scoring, chain-of-thought reasoning, and domain-specific assessments using full LLM capabilities.

:::note Databricks MLflow Feature
 Prompt-based judges rely on advanced LLM features that are currently available in Databricks MLflow. In MLflow Open Source, you can implement similar functionality using custom heuristics or guideline-based judges, but full prompt-based judge support (including `create_prompt_judge()`) requires Databricks MLflow.
:::

## Overview

With prompt-based judges, you define a template containing placeholders for the data you want to evaluate (e.g., `{{request}}`, `{{response}}`, `{{context}}`). The judge fills in those placeholders at runtime and relies on a specially-tuned LLM to:

1. Apply your custom evaluation logic (written in natural language).
2. Map choices (e.g., "excellent", "good", "poor") to numeric scores you specify.
3. Return structured feedback including the chosen label, its numeric score, and a detailed rationale.

Use prompt-based judges to:

- **Provide multi-level scores** (not just binary pass/fail).
- **Implement complex, nuanced criteria** that go beyond simple guidelines.
- **Create domain-specific assessments** tailored to your business logic.
- **Leverage chain-of-thought** by instructing the LLM to explain its reasoning in the prompt.

## Prerequisites

Before creating and using prompt-based judges, ensure:

```bash
# MLflow version 3.1.0 or newer is required
pip install --upgrade "mlflow>=3.1.0" openai

# Your MLflow environment is configured
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="your-tracking-server-uri"
```

Because prompt-based judges rely on Databricks-hosted LLMs:

- You must be running in a Databricks MLflow environment (OSS will fallback to heuristic or guideline-based evaluation).
- Ensure you have valid credentials to call the underlying LLM (via OpenAI-compatible API).

## How Prompt-based Judges Work

1. **Define a prompt template** containing placeholders for inputs (e.g., `{{request}}`, `{{response}}`, `{{context}}`, and any additional fields).
2. **Specify `choice_values`**, a mapping from each label (e.g., "excellent") to a numeric score (e.g., 1.0).
3. At evaluation time, MLflow replaces placeholders with actual data from the trace (inputs, outputs, retrieved context).
4. The underlying LLM processes the filled-in prompt, applies the evaluation logic, and selects the best label.
5. MLflow returns an `mlflow.entities.Feedback` object with:

   * `value`: the numeric score corresponding to the selected label
   * `choice`: the chosen label (text)
   * `rationale`: the LLM-generated explanation for its choice

### Example: Defining a Prompt-based Judge

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges import create_prompt_judge

# Create a judge that rates technical quality on a 3-point scale
technical_quality_judge = create_prompt_judge(
    assessment_name="technical_quality",  # Shown in MLflow UI
    prompt_template="""
Evaluate the technical depth of this response:
User Question: {{request}}
Agent Response: {{response}}
Choose the most appropriate rating based on these definitions:
- excellent: Covers advanced concepts with precision and includes relevant examples.
- good: Explains concepts clearly with adequate depth.
- poor: Provides superficial or incorrect technical content.
""",
    choice_values={
        "excellent": 1.0,
        "good": 0.7,
        "poor": 0.0,
    },
)

# Use the judge directly
feedback = technical_quality_judge(
    request="Explain how MLflow tracing works.",
    response="MLflow tracing captures the execution flow of your GenAI application by instrumenting spans for each operation...",
)

print(feedback.value)  # 0.7
print(feedback.choice)  # "good"
print(feedback.rationale)  # Detailed rationale explaining why "good"
```

## When to Use Prompt-based Judges

**Use prompt-based judges when:**

- You need **multi-level scoring** rather than simple pass/fail.
- Your evaluation criteria are **too complex for guideline-based judges** (e.g., require chain-of-thought reasoning).
- You want to leverage **advanced LLM reasoning** (e.g., explanation, step-by-step logic).
- You require **domain-specific assessments** that cannot be captured by simple heuristics.

**Consider starting with guidelines-based judges** for straightforward pass/fail criteria. Switch to prompt-based judges when you need:

- More granular scoring (e.g., 0–1 scale).
- Complex, nested evaluation logic that benefits from LLM reasoning.
- Custom prompt structures with multiple placeholders beyond request/response.

## Creating Effective Prompt-based Judges

### Template Structure

A well-structured prompt template:

1. **Clearly state the evaluation task** (e.g., "Evaluate the correctness of this response").
2. **Include all necessary context** using placeholders (e.g., `{{request}}`, `{{response}}`, `{{retrieved_documents}}`).
3. **Define each choice** with precise criteria (`excellent`, `good`, `poor`).
4. **Format consistently** so the LLM can parse and rank choices accurately.

```python
prompt_template = """
Evaluate the customer service quality of this interaction:
Customer Message: {{request}}
Agent Response: {{response}}
Company Policies: {{policies}}

Rate the response based on these criteria:
fully_resolved: The response directly addresses the customer's issue with a clear, complete solution. No further assistance needed.
partially_resolved: The response addresses the issue partially but may require follow-up.
needs_follow_up: The response fails to address the issue or misunderstands the problem.
"""
```

### Choice Values

**Map text labels to numeric scores** (commonly 0–1 scale):

```python
choice_values = {
    "fully_resolved": 1.0,
    "partially_resolved": 0.5,
    "needs_follow_up": 0.0,
}
```

**Best practices:**

- Use a **consistent numeric range** (e.g., 0–1) across judges.
- Assign **partial credit** to intermediate choices when appropriate.
- Keep mappings **uniform** if you define multiple judges for similar tasks.

### Placeholders

Placeholders in the template correspond to keyword arguments passed to the judge:

```python
prompt_template = """
Evaluate if the response cites reliable sources:
Question: {{question}}
Response: {{response}}
Available Sources: {{retrieved_documents}}
Citation Policy: {{citation_policy}}

The response must cite from available_sources for factual claims.
"""

# Invocation example:
feedback = judge(
    question="What is MLflow?",
    response="MLflow is an open-source platform...",
    retrieved_documents=["MLflow Docs: MLflow is a platform..."],
    citation_policy="Always cite when referencing facts",
)
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

To leverage LLM reasoning, include instructions for step-by-step analysis:

```python
prompt_template = """
Evaluate the reasoning in this assistant response:
User Query: {{request}}
Assistant Response: {{response}}

Step-by-step, explain whether the reasoning is logical and accurate. Then choose from:
- excellent: Fully logical, correct reasoning
- good: Mostly logical, minor mistakes
- poor: Flawed or illogical reasoning
"""
```

This instructs the LLM to provide its reasoning trace before selecting a label, improving interpretability.

## Integration with MLflow Evaluation

Prompt-based judges are invoked within custom scorers. Wrap `create_prompt_judge()` inside a decorator to integrate with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`:

```python
from mlflow.genai.scorers import scorer
from mlflow.genai.judges import create_prompt_judge


@scorer
def technical_quality_scorer(inputs, outputs, trace):
    judge = create_prompt_judge(
        assessment_name="technical_quality",
        prompt_template="""Evaluate technical quality...""",
        choice_values={"excellent": 1.0, "good": 0.7, "poor": 0.0},
    )

    # Optionally extract additional context from trace
    context = trace.data.spans[0].attributes.get("context", "")

    return judge(
        request=inputs["messages"][-1]["content"],
        response=outputs["choices"][0]["message"]["content"],
        context=context,
    )


# Evaluate with custom scorer
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=eval_dataset, predict_fn=my_app, scorers=[technical_quality_scorer]
)
```

## `create_prompt_judge()` API Signature

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges import create_prompt_judge


def create_prompt_judge(
    *,
    assessment_name: str,  # Name displayed in MLflow UI
    prompt_template: str,  # Template with {{placeholders}}
    choice_values: dict[str, float],  # Maps text choices to numeric scores
    model: Optional[str] = None  # Optional: specific LLM judge model
) -> Callable:
    """
    Returns a callable judge that accepts keyword arguments matching placeholders. The output is an mlflow.entities.Feedback object containing:
      - name: Assessment name
      - value: Numeric score
      - choice: Selected label
      - rationale: LLM-generated explanation
      - metadata: Additional details, including selected choice
    """
```

## Best Practices

**Define clear choice criteria**
- ✅ Use detailed, measurable descriptions for each label
- ❌ Avoid vague terms like "good" without context

**Use consistent scoring scales**
- ✅ Apply uniform numeric ranges (e.g., 0–1) across judges
- ❌ Assign arbitrary or inconsistent values

**Include all necessary context**
- ✅ Pass all required data via placeholders
- ❌ Assume the LLM has access to missing information

**Test with edge cases**
- ✅ Validate judge performance on boundary and ambiguous inputs
- ❌ Only test on ideal examples

**Keep prompts focused**
- ✅ Evaluate a single clear aspect per judge
- ❌ Attempt to assess multiple dimensions in one complex prompt
