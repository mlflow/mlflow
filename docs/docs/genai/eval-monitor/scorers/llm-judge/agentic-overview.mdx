# Agent-based Scorer (aka. Agent-as-a-Judge)

Agent-as-a-Judge represents a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation. Instead of simply assessing inputs and outputs, these judges act as **autonomous agents** equipped with tools to investigate your application's execution in depth.

## How it works

![](/images/mlflow-3/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge-vs-agent-judge.png)

Agent-as-a-Judge uses the following tools to investigate traces logged to the MLflow backend. These tools enable the judge to act like an experienced debugger, systematically exploring your application's execution.

| Tool               | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GetTraceInfo`     | Retrieves high-level information about a trace including timing, status, and metadata.               |
| `ListSpans`        | Lists all spans in a trace with their hierarchy, timing, and basic attributes.                       |
| `GetSpan`          | Fetches detailed information about a specific span including inputs, outputs, and custom attributes. |
| `SearchTraceRegex` | Searches for patterns across all span data using regular expressions.                                |

:::info Why not directly pass a trace to LLM?

While it works for simple cases, traces from real-world applications are often large and complex. Passing the entire trace to LLM will quickly run into context window limit and degrade the judge accuracy. Agentic-approach uses tools to explore the trace structure and fetch the necessary details without eating up the context window.

:::

## Comparison with LLM-as-a-Judge

Understanding when to use each approach depends on where you are in your development lifecycle:

| **Aspect**             | **Agent-as-a-Judge**                       | **LLM-as-a-Judge**                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ease of setup**      | Simple - just describe what to investigate | Requires careful prompt engineering and refinement |
| **What they evaluate** | Complete execution traces and trajectory   | Specific inputs and outputs fields                 |
| **Performance**        | Slower (explores trace in detail)          | Fast execution                                     |
| **Cost**               | Higher (more context and tool usage)       | Lower (less context)                               |

### When to use Agent-as-a-Judge?

Agent-as-a-Judge is suitable for **bootstrapping** the evaluation flywheel.

- Getting started with a new application
- Revising and refining your agent
- Identifying failure patterns
- Understanding unexpected behavior

### When to use LLM-as-a-Judge?

LLM-as-a-Judge is more efficient for evaluating a particular criteria, therefore suitable for **continuous evaluation** and **production use**.

- Production monitoring
- Regression testing
- Final validation before deployment
- Meeting specific quality expectations

## Quickstart

To create an Agent-as-a-Judge, simply call the `make_judge` API and pass an instruction with the **`{{ trace }}`** template variable:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.genai.judges import make_judge
import time

performance_judge = make_judge(
    name="performance_analyzer",
    instructions=(
        "Analyze the {{ trace }} for performance issues.\n\n"
        "Check for:\n"
        "- Operations taking longer than 2 seconds\n"
        "- Redundant API calls or database queries\n"
        "- Inefficient data processing patterns\n"
        "- Proper use of caching mechanisms\n\n"
        "Rate as: 'optimal', 'acceptable', or 'needs_improvement'"
    ),
    model="openai:/gpt-5",
    # model="anthropic:/claude-opus-4-1-20250805",
)
```

:::note

The usage of `{{ trace }}` template variable is important. If the template does not contain `{{ trace }}`, MLflow assumes the scorer is a normal LLM-as-a-Judge and does not use MCP tools.

:::

Then, generate a trace from your application and pass it to the scorer:

```python
@mlflow.trace
def slow_data_processor(query: str):
    """Example application with performance bottlenecks."""
    with mlflow.start_span("fetch_data") as span:
        time.sleep(2.5)
        span.set_inputs({"query": query})
        span.set_outputs({"data": ["item1", "item2", "item3"]})

    with mlflow.start_span("process_data") as span:
        for i in range(3):
            with mlflow.start_span(f"redundant_api_call_{i}"):
                time.sleep(0.5)
        span.set_outputs({"processed": "results"})

    return "Processing complete"


result = slow_data_processor("SELECT * FROM users")
trace_id = mlflow.get_last_active_trace_id()
trace = mlflow.get_trace(trace_id)

feedback = performance_judge(trace=trace)

print(f"Performance Rating: {feedback.value}")
print(f"Analysis: {feedback.rationale}")
```

```
Performance Rating: needs_improvement
Analysis: Found critical performance issues:
1. The 'fetch_data' span took 2.5 seconds, exceeding the 2-second threshold
2. Detected 3 redundant API calls (redundant_api_call_0, redundant_api_call_1,
   redundant_api_call_2) that appear to be duplicate operations
3. Total execution time of 4 seconds could be optimized by parallelizing
   the redundant operations or implementing caching
```

## Running the Judge against Batch Traces

To apply the scorer to a batch of traces, use the <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate">mlflow.genai.evaluate</APILink> API.

```python
import mlflow

# Retrieve traces from MLflow
traces = mlflow.search_traces(filter_string="timestamp > 1727174400000")

# Run evaluation with Agent-as-a-Judge
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=traces,
    scorers=[performance_judge],
)
```

## Debugging Agent Judges

To see the actual MCP tool calls that the Agent-as-a-Judge makes while analyzing your trace, enable debug logging:

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging to see agent tool calls
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger("mlflow.genai.judges")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Now when you run the judge, you'll see detailed tool usage
feedback = performance_judge(trace=trace)
```

With debug logging enabled, you'll see output like:

```
DEBUG:mlflow.genai.judges:Calling tool: GetTraceInfo
DEBUG:mlflow.genai.judges:Tool response: {"trace_id": "abc123", "duration_ms": 4000, ...}
DEBUG:mlflow.genai.judges:Calling tool: ListSpans
DEBUG:mlflow.genai.judges:Tool response: [{"span_id": "def456", "name": "fetch_data", ...}]
DEBUG:mlflow.genai.judges:Calling tool: GetSpan with span_id=def456
DEBUG:mlflow.genai.judges:Tool response: {"duration_ms": 2500, "inputs": {"query": "SELECT * FROM users"}, ...}
```
