# Create a guidelines LLM Judge

Guidelines LLM judges use pass/fail natural language criteria to evaluate GenAI outputs. They excel at evaluating:

- **Compliance**: "Must not include pricing information"
- **Style/tone**: "Maintain professional, empathetic tone"
- **Requirements**: "Must include specific disclaimers"
- **Accuracy**: "Use only facts from provided context"

### Benefits

- **Business-friendly**: Domain experts write criteria without coding
- **Flexible**: Update criteria without code changes
- **Interpretable**: Clear pass/fail conditions
- **Fast iteration**: Rapidly test new criteria

## Ways to use guidelines judges

MLflow provides the following guidelines judges:

1. [Built-in `Guidelines()` judge](#1-built-in-guidelines-judge-global-guidelines): Apply global guidelines uniformly to all rows. Evaluates app inputs/outputs only.
2. [Built-in `ExpectationsGuidelines()` judge](#2-built-in-expectationsguidelines-judge-per-row-guidelines) judge: Apply per-row guidelines labeled by domain experts in an evaluation dataset. Evaluates app inputs/outputs only.

## How guidelines work

Guidelines judges use a specially-tuned LLM to evaluate whether text meets your specified criteria. The judge:

1. **Receives context**: Any JSON dictionary containing the data to evaluate (e.g., request, response, retrieved_documents, user_preferences). You can reference these keys by name directly in your guidelines - see detailed examples
2. **Applies guidelines**: Your natural language rules defining pass/fail conditions
3. **Makes judgment**: Returns a binary pass/fail score with detailed rationale

You can change the judge model by using the model argument in the judge definition. The model must be specified in the format `<provider>:/<model-name>`, where `<provider>` is a LiteLLM-compatible model provider.

## Prerequisites for running the examples

1. Install MLflow and required packages

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade "mlflow>=3.4.0"
   ```

2. Create an MLflow experiment by following the [setup your environment quickstart](/genai/getting-started/connect-environment/).

## 1. Built-in `Guidelines()` judge: global guidelines

The `Guidelines` judge applies uniform guidelines across all rows in your evaluation. It automatically extracts request/response data from your trace and evaluates it against your guidelines.

:::important
See the examples below for how to use this approach.
:::

### Examples

In your guideline, refer to the app's inputs as the `request` and the app's outputs as the `response`.

```python
from mlflow.genai.scorers import Guidelines
import mlflow

# Example data
data = [
    {
        "inputs": {"question": "What is the capital of France?"},
        "outputs": {"response": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    },
    {
        "inputs": {"question": "What is the capital of Germany?"},
        "outputs": {"response": "The capital of Germany is Berlin."},
    },
]

# Create scorers with global guidelines
english = Guidelines(name="english", guidelines=["The response must be in English"])

clarity = Guidelines(
    name="clarity",
    guidelines=["The response must be clear, coherent, and concise"],
    model="openai:/gpt-4o-mini",  # Optional custom judge model
)

# Evaluate with global guidelines
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(data=data, scorers=[english, clarity])
```

```python
from mlflow.genai.scorers import Guidelines
import mlflow

# Create evaluation dataset with pre-computed outputs
eval_dataset = [
    {
        "inputs": {
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My order hasn't arrived yet"}]
        },
        "outputs": {
            "choices": [
                {
                    "message": {
                        "content": "I understand your concern about the delayed order. Let me help you track it right away."
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
    },
    {
        "inputs": {
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I reset my password?"}]
        },
        "outputs": {
            "choices": [
                {
                    "message": {
                        "content": "To reset your password, click 'Forgot Password' on the login page. You'll receive an email within 5 minutes."
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
    },
]

# Run evaluation on existing outputs
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=eval_dataset,
    scorers=[
        Guidelines(
            name="tone",
            guidelines="The response must maintain a courteous, respectful tone throughout. It must show empathy for customer concerns in the request",
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter    | Type               | Required | Description                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

| `guidelines` | `str \| list[str]` | Yes      | Guidelines to apply uniformly to all rows           |
| `model`      | `str`              | No       | Custom judge model                                  |

### How the Guidelines judge parses your app's inputs/outputs

The Guidelines judge automatically extracts data from your trace to create the guideline's context with the keys `request` and `response`:

#### Request

The `request` field is extracted from your `inputs`.

- If your `inputs` contains a `messages` key with an <ins>[array of OpenAI format chat messages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-messages)</ins> then:
  - If there is a single message → `request` is that message's content
  - If there are 2+ messages → `request` is the entire messages array serialized to a JSON string.

- Otherwise, `request` is the entire `inputs` dict serialized to a JSON string.

##### Examples:

**Single message input:**

```python
# Input
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I reset my password?"}]}

# Parsed request
"How can I reset my password?"
```

**Multi-turn conversation:**

```python
# Input
inputs = {
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is MLflow?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "MLflow is an open source platform..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me more about tracing"},
    ]
}

# Parsed request (JSON string)
'[{"role": "user", "content": "What is MLflow?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "MLflow is an open source platform..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me more about tracing"}]'
```

**Arbitrary dict:**

```python
# Input
inputs = {"key1": "Explain MLflow evaluation", "key2": "something else"}

# Parsed request
'{"key1": "Explain MLflow evaluation", "key2": "something else"}'
```

#### Response

The `response` field is extracted from your `outputs`:

- If your `outputs` contains an OpenAI format <ins>[ChatCompletions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object)</ins> object:
  - `response` is the first choice's content

- If your `outputs` contains a `messages` key with an <ins>[array of OpenAI format chat messages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-messages)</ins>:
  - `response` is the last message's content

- Otherwise, `response` is the `outputs` serialized to a JSON string.

##### Examples:

**ChatCompletion output:**

```python
# Output (simplified)
outputs = {
    "choices": [
        {"message": {"content": "MLflow evaluation helps measure GenAI quality..."}}
    ]
}

# Parsed response
"MLflow evaluation helps measure GenAI quality..."
```

**Messages format output:**

```python
# Output
outputs = {
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the ..."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are the key features..."},
    ]
}

# Parsed response
"Here are the key features..."
```

**Arbitrary dict:**

```python
# Output
outputs = {"key1": "Explain MLflow evaluation", "key2": "something else"}

# Parsed response
'{"key1": "Explain MLflow evaluation", "key2": "something else"}'
```

## 2. Built-in `ExpectationsGuidelines()` judge: per-row guidelines

The `ExpectationsGuidelines` judge evaluates against row-specific guidelines from domain experts. This allows different evaluation criteria for each example in your dataset.

### When to use

Use this judge when:

- You have domain experts who have labeled specific examples with custom guidelines
- Different rows require different evaluation criteria

### Example

In your guideline, refer to the app's inputs as the `request` and the app's outputs as the `response`.

```python
from mlflow.genai.scorers import ExpectationsGuidelines
import mlflow

# Dataset with per-row guidelines
data = [
    {
        "inputs": {"question": "What is the capital of France?"},
        "outputs": "The capital of France is Paris.",
        "expectations": {"guidelines": ["The response must be factual and concise"]},
    },
    {
        "inputs": {"question": "How to learn Python?"},
        "outputs": "You can read a book or take a course.",
        "expectations": {
            "guidelines": ["The response must be helpful and encouraging"]
        },
    },
]

# Evaluate with per-row guidelines
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(data=data, scorers=[ExpectationsGuidelines()])
```

## Return values

Guidelines judges return an <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Feedback">mlflow.entities.Feedback</APILink> object containing:

- `value`: Either `"yes"` (meets guidelines) or `"no"` (fails guidelines)
- `rationale`: Detailed explanation of why the content passed or failed
- `name`: The assessment name (either provided or auto-generated)
- `error`: Error details if evaluation failed

## Writing effective guidelines

Well-written guidelines are crucial for accurate evaluation. Follow these best practices:

### Reference context variables

Include any key from your context dictionary directly in guidelines:

```python
# Example 1: Validate against retrieved documents
context = {
    "request": "What is the refund policy?",
    "response": "You can return items within 30 days for a full refund.",
    "retrieved_documents": [
        "Policy: Returns accepted within 30 days",
        "Policy: No refunds after 30 days",
    ],
}
guideline = "The response must only include information from retrieved_documents"

# Example 2: Check user preferences
context = {
    "request": "Recommend a restaurant",
    "response": "I suggest trying the new steakhouse downtown",
    "user_preferences": {"dietary_restrictions": "vegetarian", "cuisine": "Italian"},
}
guideline = "The response must respect user_preferences when making recommendations"

# Example 3: Enforce business rules
context = {
    "request": "Can you apply a discount?",
    "response": "I've applied a 15% discount to your order",
    "max_allowed_discount": 10,
    "user_tier": "silver",
}
guideline = "The response must not exceed max_allowed_discount for the user_tier"

# Example 4: Multiple constraints
context = {
    "request": "Tell me about product features",
    "response": "This product includes features A, B, and C",
    "approved_features": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "deprecated_features": ["X", "Y", "Z"],
}
guideline = """The response must:
- Only mention approved_features
- Not include deprecated_features"""
```

### Best practices

**Be specific and measurable**

✅ "The response must not include specific pricing amounts or percentages"

❌ "Don't talk about money"

**Use clear pass/fail conditions**

✅ "If asked about pricing, the response must direct users to the pricing page"

❌ "Handle pricing questions appropriately"

**Reference context explicitly**

✅ "The response must only use facts present in retrieved_context"

❌ "Be factual"

**Structure complex requirements**

```python
guideline = """The response must:
- Include a greeting if first message
- Address the user's specific question
- End with an offer to help further
- Not exceed 150 words"""
```

## Real world examples

### Customer service chatbot

Here are practical guidelines examples for evaluating a customer service chatbot across different scenarios:

#### Global guidelines for all interactions

```python
from mlflow.genai.scorers import Guidelines

# Define global standards for all customer interactions
tone_guidelines = Guidelines(

    - Empathetic, acknowledging emotional context before jumping to solutions
    - Proactive in offering help without being pushy

    Specifically:
    - If the customer expresses frustration, anger, or disappointment, the first sentence must acknowledge their emotion
    - The response must use "I" statements to take ownership (e.g., "I understand" not "We understand")
    - The response must avoid phrases that minimize concerns like "simply", "just", or "obviously"
    - The response must end with a specific next step or open-ended offer to help, not generic closings""",
)

compliance_guidelines = Guidelines(
    name="policy_compliance",
    guidelines=[
        """Refund and return policies:
        - The response must not promise refunds beyond the 30-day return window
        - The response must mention restocking fees for electronics (15%) if discussing returns
        - For items over $500, the response must note that manager approval is required
        - The response must not waive shipping fees without checking customer loyalty tier""",
        """Data privacy and security:
        - The response must never ask for full credit card numbers, SSN, or passwords
        - The response must not reference other customers' orders or information
        - When discussing order details, the response must only reference the last 4 digits of payment methods
        - The response must direct customers to secure portal for updating payment information""",
        """Commitment limitations:
        - The response must not guarantee specific delivery dates without system verification
        - The response must include disclaimer about "estimated" times when discussing shipping

                    }

### Document extraction app

Here are practical guidelines examples for evaluating a document extraction application:

#### Global guidelines for extraction quality

```python
from mlflow.genai.scorers import Guidelines
import mlflow


# Define extraction accuracy standards
extraction_accuracy = Guidelines(
    name="extraction_accuracy",
    guidelines=[
        """Field extraction completeness and accuracy:
       - The response must extract ALL requested fields, using exact values from source
       - For ambiguous data, the response must extract the most likely value and include a confidence score
       - When multiple values exist for one field (e.g., multiple addresses), extract all and label them
       - Preserve original formatting for IDs, reference numbers, and codes (including leading zeros)
       - For missing fields, use null with reason: {"field": null, "reason": "not_found"} """,
        """Numerical and financial data handling:
       - Currency values must preserve exact decimal places as shown in source
       - Must differentiate between currencies if multiple are present (USD, EUR, etc.)
       - Percentage values must clarify if they're decimals (0.15) or percentages (15%)
       - For calculated fields (totals, tax), must match source exactly - no recalculation
       - Negative values must be preserved with proper notation (-$100 or ($100))""",
        """Entity recognition and validation:
       - Company names must be extracted exactly as written (including suffixes like Inc., LLC)
       - Person names must preserve original order and formatting
       - Must not merge similar entities (e.g., "John Smith" and "J. Smith" are kept separate)
       - Email addresses and phone numbers must be validated for basic format
       - Physical addresses must include all components present in source""",
    ],
)


format_compliance = Guidelines(
    name="output_format",
    guidelines="""Output structure must meet these enterprise data standards:


   JSON Structure Requirements:
   - Must be valid JSON that passes strict parsing
   - All field names must use snake_case consistently
   - Nested objects must maintain hierarchy from source document
   - Arrays must be used for multiple values, never concatenated strings


   Data Type Standards:
   - Dates: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) with timezone if available
   - Timestamps: ISO 8601 with time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
   - Currency: {"amount": 1234.56, "currency": "USD", "formatted": "$1,234.56"}
   - Phone: {"number": "+14155551234", "formatted": "(415) 555-1234", "type": "mobile"}
   - Boolean: true/false (not "yes"/"no" or 1/0)


   Metadata Requirements:
   - Include extraction_timestamp in UTC
   - Include source_page for multi-page documents
   - Include confidence_score (0-1) for each ML-extracted field
   - Include validation_flags array for any data quality issues detected""",
