# Built-in LLM Judges

MLflow provides several pre-configured LLM judges optimized for common evaluation scenarios.

## Example Usage

<TabsWrapper>
<Tabs groupId="creation-method">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="UI" default>

:::note[Version Requirements]
The Judge Builder UI requires **MLflow >= 3.9.0**.
:::

The MLflow UI provides a visual Judge Builder that lets you create custom LLM judges without writing code.

1. Navigate to your experiment and select the **Judges** tab, then click **New LLM judge**

2. **LLM judge**: Select a built-in judge. We're using the `RelevanceToQuery` and `Correctness` judges in this example.

<ImageBox src="/images/mlflow-3/eval-monitor/scorers/relevance-create-judge-ui.png" alt="RelevanceToQuery Judge UI" />

3. Click **Create judge** to save your new LLM judge

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sdk" label="SDK">

To use the built-in LLM judges, select the judge class from the [available judges](#available-judges) and pass it to the `scorers` argument of the <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate">evaluate</APILink> function.

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.genai.scorers import Correctness, RelevanceToQuery, Guidelines

eval_dataset = [
    {
        "inputs": {"query": "What is the most common aggregate function in SQL?"},
        "outputs": "The most common aggregate function in SQL is SUM().",
        # Correctness judge requires an "expected_facts" field.
        "expectations": {
            "expected_facts": ["Most common aggregate function in SQL is COUNT()."],
        },
    },
    {
        "inputs": {"query": "How do I use MLflow?"},
        # verbose answer
        "outputs": "Hi, I'm a chatbot that answers questions about MLflow. Thank you for asking a great question! I know MLflow well and I'm glad to help you with that. You will love it! MLflow is a Python-based platform that provides a comprehensive set of tools for logging, tracking, and visualizing machine learning models and experiments throughout their entire lifecycle. It consists of four main components: MLflow Tracking for experiment management, MLflow Projects for reproducible runs, MLflow Models for standardized model packaging, and MLflow Model Registry for centralized model lifecycle management. To get started, simply install it with 'pip install mlflow' and then use mlflow.start_run() to begin tracking your experiments with automatic logging of parameters, metrics, and artifacts. The platform creates a beautiful web UI where you can compare different runs, visualize metrics over time, and manage your entire ML workflow efficiently. MLflow integrates seamlessly with popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and many others, making it incredibly easy to incorporate into your existing projects!",
        "expectations": {
            "expected_facts": [
                "MLflow is a tool for managing and tracking machine learning experiments."
            ],
        },
    },
]

results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=eval_dataset,
    scorers=[
        Correctness(),
        RelevanceToQuery(),
    ],
)

\*Can extract expectations from trace assessments if available.

\*\*Indicates experimental features that may change in future releases.

### Multi-Turn

Multi-turn judges evaluate entire conversation sessions rather than individual turns. They require traces with session IDs and are experimental in MLflow 3.7.0. See [Track Users and Sessions](/genai/tracing/track-users-sessions/)

:::info Multi-Turn Evaluation Requirements
Multi-turn judges require:

1. **Session IDs**: Traces must have `mlflow.trace.session` metadata
2. **List or DataFrame input**: Currently only supports pre-collected traces (no `predict_fn` support yet)

:::tip

Typically, you can get started with evaluation using built-in judges. However, every AI application is unique and has domain-specific quality criteria. At some point, you'll need to create your own custom LLM judges.

- Your application has complex inputs/outputs that built-in judges can't parse
- You need to evaluate specific business logic or domain-specific criteria
- You want to combine multiple evaluation aspects into a single judge

See <ins>[custom LLM judges](/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/guidelines)</ins> guide for detailed examples.
