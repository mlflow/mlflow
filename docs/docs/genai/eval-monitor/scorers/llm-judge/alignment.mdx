# Judge Alignment: Teaching AI to Match Human Preferences

## Transform Generic Judges into Domain Experts

Judge alignment is the process of refining LLM judges to match human evaluation standards. Through systematic learning from human feedback, judges evolve from generic evaluators to domain-specific experts that understand your unique quality criteria.

## Why Alignment Matters

Even the most sophisticated LLMs need calibration to match your specific evaluation standards. What constitutes "good" customer service varies by industry. Medical accuracy requirements differ from general health advice. Alignment bridges this gap, teaching judges your specific quality standards through example.

## Quick Start: Align Your First Judge

:::warning[Critical Requirement for Alignment]
For alignment to work, each trace must have BOTH judge assessments AND human feedback **with the same assessment name**. The alignment process learns by comparing judge assessments with human feedback on the same traces.

**The assessment name must exactly match the judge name** - if your judge is named "product_quality", both the judge's assessments and human feedback must use the name "product_quality".

The order doesn't matter - humans can provide feedback before or after the judge evaluates.

**Note**: Alignment is currently supported only for field-based evaluation using `{{ inputs }}` and `{{ outputs }}` templates. Support for Agent-as-a-Judge evaluation (`{{ trace }}`) and expectations (`{{ expectations }}`) is not yet available.
:::

### Step 1: Setup and Generate Traces

First, create your judge and generate traces with initial assessments:

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges import make_judge
from mlflow.genai.judges.optimizers import SIMBAAlignmentOptimizer
from mlflow.entities import AssessmentSource, AssessmentSourceType
import mlflow

# Create experiment and initial judge
experiment_id = mlflow.create_experiment("product-quality-alignment")
mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_id=experiment_id)

initial_judge = make_judge(
    name="product_quality",
    instructions=(
        "Evaluate if the product description in {{ outputs }} "
        "is accurate and helpful for the query in {{ inputs }}. "
        "Rate as: excellent, good, fair, or poor"
    ),
    model="anthropic:/claude-opus-4-1-20250805",
)

# Generate traces from your application (minimum 10 required)
traces = []
for i in range(15):  # Generate 15 traces (more than minimum of 10)
    with mlflow.start_span(f"product_description_{i}") as span:
        # Your application logic
        query = f"Product query {i}"
        description = f"Product description for query {i}"
        span.set_inputs({"query": query})
        span.set_outputs({"description": description})
        traces.append(span.trace_id)

# Run the judge on these traces to get initial assessments
for trace_id in traces:
    trace = mlflow.get_trace(trace_id)

    # Extract inputs and outputs from the trace for field-based evaluation
    inputs = trace.data.spans[0].inputs  # Get inputs from trace
    outputs = trace.data.spans[0].outputs  # Get outputs from trace

    # Judge evaluates using field-based approach (inputs/outputs)
    judge_result = initial_judge(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    # Judge's assessment is automatically logged when called
```

### Step 2: Collect Human Feedback

After running your judge on traces, you need to collect human feedback. You can either:

- **Use the MLflow UI** (recommended): Review traces and add feedback through the intuitive interface
- **Log programmatically**: If you already have ground truth labels

For detailed instructions on collecting feedback, see [Collecting Feedback for Alignment](#collecting-feedback-for-alignment) below.

### Step 3: Align and Register

After collecting feedback, align your judge and register it:

<TabsWrapper>
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="default" label="Default Optimizer (Recommended)" default>

```python
# Retrieve traces with both judge and human assessments
traces_for_alignment = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment_id], max_results=15, return_type="list"
)

# Align the judge using human corrections (minimum 10 traces recommended)
if len(traces_for_alignment) >= 10:
    optimizer = SIMBAAlignmentOptimizer(model="anthropic:/claude-opus-4-1-20250805")

    # Run alignment - shows minimal progress by default:
    # INFO: Starting SIMBA optimization with 15 examples (set logging to DEBUG for detailed output)
    # INFO: SIMBA optimization completed
    aligned_judge = initial_judge.align(optimizer, traces_for_alignment)

    # Register the aligned judge
    aligned_judge.register(experiment_id=experiment_id)
    print("Judge aligned successfully with human feedback")
else:
    print(f"Need at least 10 traces for alignment, have {len(traces_for_alignment)}")
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="explicit" label="Explicit Optimizer">

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges.optimizers import SIMBAAlignmentOptimizer

# Retrieve traces with both judge and human assessments
traces_for_alignment = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment_id], max_results=15, return_type="list"
)

# Align the judge using human corrections (minimum 10 traces recommended)
if len(traces_for_alignment) >= 10:
    # Explicitly specify SIMBA with custom model configuration
    optimizer = SIMBAAlignmentOptimizer(model="anthropic:/claude-opus-4-1-20250805")
    aligned_judge = initial_judge.align(traces_for_alignment, optimizer)

    # Register the aligned judge
    aligned_judge.register(experiment_id=experiment_id)
    print("Judge aligned successfully with human feedback")
else:
    print(f"Need at least 10 traces for alignment, have {len(traces_for_alignment)}")
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabsWrapper>

## The SIMBA Alignment Optimizer

MLflow provides the **default alignment optimizer** using [DSPy's implementation of SIMBA](https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/SIMBA/) (Simplified Multi-Bootstrap Aggregation). When you call `align()` without specifying an optimizer, the SIMBA optimizer is used automatically:

```python
# Default: Uses SIMBA optimizer automatically
aligned_judge = initial_judge.align(traces_with_feedback)

# Explicit: Same as above but with custom model specification
from mlflow.genai.judges.optimizers import SIMBAAlignmentOptimizer

optimizer = SIMBAAlignmentOptimizer(
    model="anthropic:/claude-opus-4-1-20250805"  # Model used for optimization
)
aligned_judge = initial_judge.align(traces_with_feedback, optimizer)

# Requirements for alignment:
# - Minimum 10 traces with BOTH judge assessments and human feedback
# - Both assessments must use the same name (matching the judge name)
# - Order doesn't matter - humans can assess before or after judge
# - Mix of agreements and disagreements between judge and human recommended
```

:::tip[Default Optimizer Behavior]
When using `align()` without an optimizer parameter, MLflow automatically uses the SIMBA optimizer. This simplifies the alignment process while still allowing customization when needed.
:::

### Controlling Optimization Output

By default, alignment shows minimal progress information to keep logs clean. If you need to debug the optimization process or see detailed iteration progress, enable DEBUG logging:

```python
import logging

# Enable detailed optimization output
logging.getLogger("mlflow.genai.judges.optimizers.simba").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Now alignment will show:
# - Detailed iteration-by-iteration progress
# - Score improvements at each step
# - Strategy selection details
# - Full DSPy optimization output

aligned_judge = initial_judge.align(optimizer, traces_with_feedback)

# Reset to default (minimal output) after debugging
logging.getLogger("mlflow.genai.judges.optimizers.simba").setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

:::tip[When to Use Detailed Logging]
Enable DEBUG logging when:

- Optimization seems stuck or is taking too long
- You want to understand how the optimizer is improving instructions
- Debugging alignment failures or unexpected results
- Learning how SIMBA optimization works internally

Keep it at INFO (default) for production use to avoid verbose output.

## Collecting Feedback for Alignment

The quality of alignment depends on the quality and quantity of feedback. Choose the approach that best fits your situation:

### Feedback Collection Approaches

<TabsWrapper>
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ui" label="MLflow UI (Recommended)" default>

**When to use:** You don't have existing ground truth labels and need to collect human feedback.

The MLflow UI provides an intuitive interface for reviewing traces and adding feedback:

1. **Navigate to the Traces tab** in your experiment
2. **Click on individual traces** to review inputs, outputs, and any existing judge assessments
3. **Add feedback** by clicking the "Add Feedback" button
4. **Select the assessment name** that matches your judge name (e.g., "product_quality")
5. **Provide your rating** according to your evaluation criteria

**Tips for effective feedback collection:**

- If you're **not a domain expert**: Distribute traces among team members or domain experts for review
- If you **are the domain expert**: Create a rubric or guidelines document to ensure consistency
- For **multiple reviewers**: Organize feedback sessions where reviewers can work through batches together
- For **consistency**: Document your evaluation criteria clearly before starting

The UI automatically logs feedback in the correct format for alignment.

<ImageBox src="/images/assessments/add_feedback_ui.png" alt="MLflow UI Feedback Interface" width="800px" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="programmatic" label="Programmatic (Ground Truth)">

**When to use:** You have existing ground truth labels from your data.

If you already have labeled data, you can programmatically log it as feedback:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import AssessmentSource, AssessmentSourceType

# Your existing ground truth dataset
ground_truth_data = [
    {"trace_id": "trace1", "label": "excellent", "query": "What is MLflow?"},
    {"trace_id": "trace2", "label": "poor", "query": "How to use tracking?"},
    {"trace_id": "trace3", "label": "good", "query": "How to log models?"},
]

# Log ground truth as feedback for alignment
for item in ground_truth_data:
    mlflow.log_feedback(
        trace_id=item["trace_id"],
        name="product_quality",  # Must match your judge name
        value=item["label"],
        source=AssessmentSource(
            source_type=AssessmentSourceType.HUMAN, source_id="ground_truth_dataset"
        ),
    )

print(f"Logged {len(ground_truth_data)} ground truth labels for alignment")
```

This approach is efficient when you have pre-labeled data from:

• Previous manual labeling efforts
• Expert annotations
• Production feedback systems
• Test datasets with known correct answers

## Custom Alignment Optimizers

MLflow's alignment system is designed as a **plugin architecture**, allowing you to create custom optimizers for different alignment strategies. This extensibility enables you to implement domain-specific optimization approaches while leveraging MLflow's judge infrastructure.

### Creating a Custom Optimizer

To create a custom alignment optimizer, extend the <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.judges.base.AlignmentOptimizer">AlignmentOptimizer</APILink> abstract base class:

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges.base import AlignmentOptimizer, Judge
from mlflow.entities.trace import Trace


class MyCustomOptimizer(AlignmentOptimizer):
    """Custom optimizer implementation for judge alignment."""

    def __init__(self, model: str = None, **kwargs):
        """Initialize your optimizer with custom parameters."""
        self.model = model
        # Add any custom initialization logic

    def align(self, judge: Judge, traces: list[Trace]) -> Judge:
        """
        Implement your alignment algorithm.

        Args:
            judge: The judge to be optimized
            traces: List of traces containing human feedback

        Returns:
            A new Judge instance with improved alignment
        """
        # Your custom alignment logic here
        # 1. Extract feedback from traces
        # 2. Analyze disagreements between judge and human
        # 3. Generate improved instructions
        # 4. Return new judge with better alignment

        # Example: Return judge with modified instructions
        from mlflow.genai.judges import make_judge

        improved_instructions = self._optimize_instructions(judge.instructions, traces)

        return make_judge(
            name=judge.name,
            instructions=improved_instructions,
            model=judge.model,
        )

    def _optimize_instructions(self, instructions: str, traces: list[Trace]) -> str:
        """Your custom optimization logic."""
        # Implement your optimization strategy
        pass
```

### Using Custom Optimizers

Once implemented, use your custom optimizer just like the built-in ones:

```python
# Create your custom optimizer
custom_optimizer = MyCustomOptimizer(model="your-model")

# Use it for alignment
aligned_judge = initial_judge.align(traces_with_feedback, custom_optimizer)
```

### Available Optimizers

MLflow currently provides:

- **SIMBAAlignmentOptimizer** (default): Uses [DSPy's Simplified Multi-Bootstrap Aggregation](https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/SIMBA/) for robust alignment
- **Custom optimizers**: Extend `AlignmentOptimizer` to implement your own strategies

The plugin architecture ensures that new optimization strategies can be added without modifying the core judge system, promoting extensibility and experimentation with different alignment approaches.

## Testing Alignment Effectiveness

Validate that alignment improved your judge:

```python
def test_alignment_improvement(
    original_judge, aligned_judge, test_traces: list
) -> dict:
    """Compare judge performance before and after alignment."""

    original_correct = 0
    aligned_correct = 0

    for trace in test_traces:
        # Get human ground truth from trace assessments
        feedbacks = trace.search_assessments(type="feedback")
        human_feedback = next(
            (f for f in feedbacks if f.source.source_type == "HUMAN"), None
        )

        if not human_feedback:
            continue

        # Get judge evaluations
        original_eval = original_judge(trace=trace)
        aligned_eval = aligned_judge(trace=trace)

        # Check agreement with human
        if original_eval.value == human_feedback.value:
            original_correct += 1
        if aligned_eval.value == human_feedback.value:
            aligned_correct += 1

    total = len(test_traces)
    return {
        "original_accuracy": original_correct / total,
        "aligned_accuracy": aligned_correct / total,
        "improvement": (aligned_correct - original_correct) / total,
    }
```
