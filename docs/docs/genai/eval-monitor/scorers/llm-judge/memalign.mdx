# MemAlign Optimizer (Experimental)

:::warning[Experimental Feature]
MemAlign is an experimental optimizer. The API may change in future releases.
:::

**MemAlign** is an experimental optimizer that uses a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition to learn from natural language feedback. It offers significant speed and cost advantages over traditional prompt optimizers.

## Requirements

For alignment to work:

- Traces must contain human assessments (labels) with the same name as the judge
- Natural language feedback (rationale) is highly recommended for better alignment
- A mix of positive and negative labels is recommended

## How MemAlign Works

MemAlign maintains two types of memory:

- **Semantic Memory**: Stores distilled guidelines extracted from feedback. When an expert explains their decision, MemAlign extracts generalizable rules like "Always evaluate safety based on intent, not just language."

- **Episodic Memory**: Holds specific examples, particularly edge cases where the judge made mistakes. These serve as concrete anchors for situations that resist easy generalization.

When evaluating new inputs, MemAlign constructs a dynamic context by gathering all principles from semantic memory and retrieving the most relevant examples from episodic memory—similar to how human judges reference both a rulebook and case history.

## Installation

MemAlign requires additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install mlflow[genai] dspy jinja2 tqdm
```

## Basic Usage

See [make_judge documentation](/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/make-judge) for details on creating judges.

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.genai.judges import make_judge
from mlflow.genai.judges.optimizers import MemAlignOptimizer

# Create a judge
judge = make_judge(
    name="politeness",
    instructions=(
        "Evaluate if the response is polite and respectful. "
        "Consider the tone, language, and context of the response.\n\n"
        "Response: {{ outputs }}"
    ),
    feedback_value_type=bool,
    model="openai:/gpt-5-mini",
)

# Create the MemAlign optimizer
optimizer = MemAlignOptimizer(
    reflection_lm="openai:/gpt-5-mini",
)

# Retrieve traces with human feedback
traces = mlflow.search_traces(return_type="list")

# Align the judge
aligned_judge = judge.align(traces=traces, optimizer=optimizer)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `reflection_lm` | `str` | Required | Model used for extracting guidelines from feedback. |
| `retrieval_k` | `int` | `5` | Number of relevant examples to retrieve from episodic memory during inference. |
| `embedding_model` | `str` | `"openai/text-embedding-3-small"` | Model for episodic memory retrieval. Must be in `<provider>/<model-name>` format. |

## Inspecting Learned Knowledge

After alignment, you can inspect what the judge has learned by viewing the updated instructions:

```python
# View the updated instructions with distilled guidelines
print(aligned_judge.instructions)
# Output includes appended guidelines like:
# "Distilled Guidelines (7):
#   - Responses must be factually accurate...
#   - Use neutral, descriptive language..."
```

## Removing Feedback (Unalignment)

If requirements change or feedback was incorrect, you can selectively remove learned knowledge:

```python
import mlflow

# Retrieve traces with outdated or incorrect feedback
traces_to_forget: list[mlflow.entities.Trace] = mlflow.search_traces(
    filter_string="tag.outdated = 'true'",
    return_type="list",
)

# Remove knowledge derived from those traces
updated_judge = aligned_judge.unalign(traces=traces_to_forget)
```

## Debugging

To debug the optimization process, enable DEBUG logging:

```python
import logging

logging.getLogger("mlflow.genai.judges.optimizers.memalign").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
aligned_judge = judge.align(traces=traces, optimizer=optimizer)
```
