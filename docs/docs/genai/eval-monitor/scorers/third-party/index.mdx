# Third-party Scorers

MLflow integrates with popular third-party evaluation frameworks, allowing you to leverage their specialized metrics within MLflow's evaluation workflow. This provides access to third party library's evaluation metrics while maintaining a consistent MLflow interface.

MLflow's third-party scorer integrations provide:

- **Consistent MLflow API** for all evaluation frameworks
- **Unified evaluation** across multiple metric sources
- **Seamless integration** with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`
