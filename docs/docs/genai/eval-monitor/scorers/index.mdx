# What are Scorers?

**Scorers** are key components of the MLflow GenAI evaluation framework. They provide a unified interface to define evaluation criteria for your models, agents, and applications.

Scorers can be considered as **metrics** in the traditional ML sense. However, they are more flexible and can return more structured quality feedback, not only the scalar values that are typically represented by metrics.

## How scorers work

Scorers analyze inputs, outputs, and traces from your GenAI application and produce quality assessments. Here's the flow:

1. You provide a dataset of <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-green-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-green-900">inputs</div> (and optionally other columns such as <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-yellow-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-yellow-900">expectations</div>)
2. MLflow runs your `predict_fn` to generate <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-orange-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-orange-900">outputs</div> and <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-cyan-900">traces</div> for each row in the dataset. Alternatively, you can provide outputs and traces directly in the dataset and omit the predict function.
3. Scorers receive the <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-green-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-green-900">inputs</div>, <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-orange-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-orange-900">outputs</div>, <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-yellow-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-yellow-900">expectations</div>, and <div className="inline-flex rounded-sm bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-cyan-900">traces</div> (or a subset of them) and produce scores and metadata such as explanations and source information.
4. MLflow aggregates the scorer results and saves them. You can analyze the results in the UI.

## Evaluation Approaches Comparison

Evaluating the quality of your GenAI application can be done in different ways. Here's a comparison of the different approaches and how you can use them in MLflow. Click on the guide links to learn more about each approach:

| Type             | Heuristic                                            | LLM-based                                                  | Human                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**  | Deterministic metrics such as `exact_match`, `BLEU`. | Let LLMs judge subjective qualities such as `Correctness`  | Ask domain experts or users to provide feedback.                  |
| **Cost**         | Minimal                                              | API costs for LLM calls                                    | High (human time)                                                 |
| **Scalability**  | Highly scalable                                      | Scalable                                                   | Limited                                                           |
| **Consistency**  | Perfect consistency                                  | Somewhat consistent (if prompted well)                     | Variable (inter-annotator agreement)                              |
| **Flexibility**  | Limited to predefined patterns                       | Highly flexible with custom prompts                        | Maximum flexibility                                               |
