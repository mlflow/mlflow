# Integrations

--- INSTRUCTION TO AUTHOR ---
This guide shows how to define scorers that integrates with 3rd party libraries.

This page explains
- Each section shows example of using 3rd party libraries inside the custom scorer function (@scorer decorator) and compute the results with mlflow.genai.evaluate

For example, Ragas can be integrated like

```
from ragas.metrics import FactualCorrectness
@scorer
def ragas_factual_correctness(outputs, expectations) -> float:
    sample = SingleTurnSample(outputs, expectations[“expected_facts”])
    return FactualCorrectness(llm=...).single_turn_ascore(sample)
```

When writing this page, research on the integrated library to how to write a scorer.
