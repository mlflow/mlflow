# Evaluating Agents

AI Agents are an emerging pattern of GenAI applications that can use tools, make decisions, and execute multi-step workflows. However, evaluating the performance of those complex agents is challenging. MLflow provides a powerful toolkit to systematically evaluate the agent behavior precisely using traces and scorers.

## Example: Evaluating a Tool-Calling Agent

### Prerequisites

First, install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mlflow>=3.3 openai
```

MLflow stores evaluation results in a tracking server. Connect your local environment to the tracking server by one of the following methods.

<ServerSetup />

### Step 1: Build an agent

Create a math agent that can use tools to answer questions. We use [OpenAI Agents](/genai/tracing/integrations/listing/openai-agent) to build the tool-calling agent in a few lines of code.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool


@function_tool
def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b


@function_tool
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiply two numbers."""
    return a * b


@function_tool
def modular(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Modular arithmetic"""
    return a % b


agent = Agent(
    name="Math Agent",
    instructions=(
        "You will be given a math question. Calculate the answer using the given calculator tools. "
        "Return the final number only as an integer."
    ),
    tools=[add, multiply, modular],
)
```

Make sure you can run the agent locally.

```python
from agents import Runner

result = await Runner.run(agent, "What is 15% of 240?")
print(result.final_output)
# 36
```

Lastly, let's wrap it in a function that MLflow can call. Note that MLflow runs each prediction in a threadpool,
so using a synchronous function does not slow down the evaluation.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# If you are using Jupyter Notebook, you need to apply nest_asyncio.
# import nest_asyncio
# nest_asyncio.apply()


def predict_fn(question: str) -> str:
    return Runner.run_sync(agent, question).final_output
```

### Step 2: Create evaluation dataset

Design test cases as a list of dictionaries, each with an `inputs`, `expectations`, and an optional `tags` field. We would like to evaluate the correctness of the output, but also the tool calls used by the agent.

```python
eval_dataset = [
    {
        "inputs": {"task": "What is 15% of 240?"},
        "expectations": {"answer": 36, "tool_calls": ["multiply"]},
        "tags": {"topic": "math"},
    },
    {
        "inputs": {
            "task": "I have 8 cookies and 3 friends. How many more cookies should I buy to share equally?"
        },
        "expectations": {"answer": 1, "tool_calls": ["modular", "add"]},
        "tags": {"topic": "math"},
    },
    {
        "inputs": {
            "task": "I bought 2 shares of stock at $100 each. It's now worth $150. How much profit did I make?"
        },
        "expectations": {"answer": 100, "tool_calls": ["add", "multiply"]},
        "tags": {"topic": "math"},
    },
]
```

### Step 3: Define agent-specific scorers

Create scorers that evaluate agent-specific behaviors.

:::tip

MLflow's scorer can take the **Trace** from the agent execution. Trace is a powerful way to evaluate the agent's behavior precisely, not only the final output. For example, here we use the <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Trace.search_spans">`Trace.search_spans`</APILink> method to extract the order of tool calls and compare it with the expected tool calls.

For more details, see the <ins>[Evaluate Traces](/genai/eval-monitor/running-evaluation/traces)</ins> guide.

:::

```python
from mlflow.entities import Feedback, SpanType, Trace
from mlflow.genai import scorer


@scorer
def exact_match(outputs, expectations) -> bool:
    return int(outputs) == expectations["answer"]


@scorer
def uses_correct_tools(trace: Trace, expectations: dict) -> Feedback:
    """Evaluate if agent used tools appropriately"""
    expected_tools = expectations["tool_calls"]

    # Parse the trace to get the actual tool calls
    tool_spans = trace.search_spans(span_type=SpanType.TOOL)
    tool_names = [span.name for span in tool_spans]

    score = "yes" if tool_names == expected_tools else "no"
    rationale = (
        "The agent used the correct tools."
        if tool_names == expected_tools
        else f"The agent used the incorrect tools: {tool_names}"
    )
    # Return a Feedback object with the score and rationale
    return Feedback(value=score, rationale=rationale)
```

### Step 4: Run the evaluation

Now we are ready to run the evaluation!

```python
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=eval_dataset, predict_fn=predict_fn, scorers=[exact_match, uses_correct_tools]
)
```

Once the evaluation is done, open the MLflow UI in your browser and navigate to the experiment page. You should see MLflow creates a new Run and logs the evaluation results.

<ImageBox src="/images/mlflow-3/eval-monitor/agent-evaluation-result.png" alt="Agent Evaluation" width="95%"/>

It seems the agent does not call tools in the correct order for the second test case. Let's click on the row to **open the trace and inspect what happened under the hood**.

<ImageBox src="/images/mlflow-3/eval-monitor/agent-evaluation-trace.png" alt="Agent Evaluation" width="95%"/>

By looking at the trace, we can figure out the agent computes the answer in three steps (1) compute 100 _ 2 (2) compute 150 _ 2 (3) subtract the two results. However, the more effective way is (1) subtract 100 from 150 (2) multiply the result by 2. In the next version, we can update the system instruction to use tools in a more effective way.

## Configure parallelization

Running a complex agent can take a long time. MLflow by default uses background threadpool to speed up the evaluation process. You can configure the number of workers to use by setting the `MLFLOW_GENAI_EVAL_MAX_WORKERS` environment variable.

```bash
export MLFLOW_GENAI_EVAL_MAX_WORKERS=10
```

## Evaluating MLflow Models

In MLflow 2.x, you can pass the model URI directly to the `model` argument of the legacy <APILink fn="mlflow.evaluate" /> API (deprecated). The new GenAI evaluation API in MLflow **3.x** still support evaluating MLflow Models, but the workflow is slightly different.

```python
import mlflow

# Load the model **outside** the prediction function.
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("models:/math_agent/1")


# Wrap the model in a function that MLflow can call.
def predict_fn(question: str) -> str:
    return model.predict(question)


# Run the evaluation as usual.
mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=eval_dataset, predict_fn=predict_fn, scorers=[exact_match, uses_correct_tools]
)
```
