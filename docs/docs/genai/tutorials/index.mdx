# MLflow GenAI Tutorials

Learn how to build production-ready GenAI applications with MLflow through hands-on tutorials that guide you through the complete continuous improvement cycle.

## Tutorial Progression

These tutorials build on each other to teach you the complete MLflow workflow:

1. **[Debug and Instrument Your GenAI App](/genai/tutorials/debug-tracing)**
   From black box to full visibility - learn how to instrument your app with tracing and debug common issues.

2. **[Build and Tune Quality Metrics](/genai/tutorials/dev-quality-iteration)**
   Measure what matters - create custom quality metrics, build evaluation datasets, and run your first evaluations.

3. **[Leverage Production Data for Continuous Improvement](/genai/tutorials/enhance-quality)**
   From production to perfection - use real-world data, expert feedback, and systematic testing to improve quality.


## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should:

- Have MLflow installed (`pip install --upgrade mlflow`). If you are running a version of MLflow 2.x, we recommend updating to MLflow 3.
- Have a basic GenAI application (we provide sample code if needed)
- Understand basic Python programming
- Have access to an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar)

## What You'll Learn

By completing these tutorials, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Instrument any GenAI app with comprehensive tracing
- ✅ Debug latency, errors, and quality issues effectively
- ✅ Create custom quality metrics aligned with your business needs
- ✅ Build and manage evaluation datasets from real-world data
