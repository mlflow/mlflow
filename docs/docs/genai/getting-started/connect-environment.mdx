MLflow is open source, and you can set up the MLflow server using either `pip` or `docker`.

Before you can leverage MLflow for your GenAI application development, you must first start the MLflow server.

<ServerSetup />

This will start the server at port 5000 on your local machine and you can access the MLflow web UI at http://localhost:5000.
