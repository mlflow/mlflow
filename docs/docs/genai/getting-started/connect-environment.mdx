# Connect Your Development Environment to MLflow

This guide shows you how to connect your development environment to an MLflow Experiment. You can run MLflow on your local machine, self-host the open source MLflow service.

:::info

If you are using MLflow on Databricks, please visit <ins>[this](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/mlflow3/genai/getting-started/)</ins> for environment setup instructions specific to Databricks.

:::

## Prerequisites

**Python Environment**: Python 3.10+ with pip installed

## Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Install MLflow

```bash
pip install --upgrade "mlflow>=3.1"
```

#### Step 2: Configure Tracking

MLflow supports different backends for tracking your experiment data. Choose one of the following options to get started. Refer to the [Self Hosting Guide](/self-hosting) for detailed setup and configurations.

**Option A: Database (Recommended)**

Set the tracking URI to a local database URI (e.g., `sqlite:///mlflow.db`). This is recommended option for quickstart and local development.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("sqlite:///mlflow.db")
mlflow.set_experiment("my-genai-experiment")
```

**Option B: File System**

MLflow will automatically use local file storage if no tracking URI is specified:

```python
import mlflow

# Creates local mlruns directory for experiments
mlflow.set_experiment("my-genai-experiment")
```

:::warning[TO BE DEPRECATED SOON]

File system backend is in Keep-the-Light-On (KTLO) mode and will not receive most of the new features in MLflow.
We recommend using the database backend instead. Database backend will also be the default option soon.

:::

**Option C: Remote Tracking Server**

Start a remote MLflow tracking server following the [Self Hosting Guide](/self-hosting).
Then configure your client to use the remote server:

```python
import mlflow

# Connect to remote MLflow server
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("my-genai-experiment")
```

Alternatively, you can configure the tracking URI and experiment using environment variables:

```bash
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://localhost:5000"
export MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME="my-genai-experiment"
```

#### Step 3: Verify Your Connection

Create a test file and run this code:

```python
import mlflow

# Print connection information
print(f"MLflow Tracking URI: {mlflow.get_tracking_uri()}")
print(f"Active Experiment: {mlflow.get_experiment_by_name('my-genai-experiment')}")

# Test logging
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("test_param", "test_value")
    print("✓ Successfully connected to MLflow!")
```

#### Step 4: Access MLflow UI

If you are using local tracking (option A or B), run the following command and access the MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000`.

```bash
# For Option A
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --port 5000
# For Option B
mlflow server --port 5000
```

If you have the remote tracking server running (option C), access the MLflow UI at the same URI.

:::info[ACCESS DENIED?]

When using the remote tracking server, you may hit an access denied error when accessing the MLflow UI
from a browser.

> Invalid Host header - possible DNS rebinding attack detected

This error typically indicates that the tracking server's network security settings need to be configured.
The most common causes are:

- **Host validation**: The `--allowed-hosts` flag restricts which Host headers are accepted
- **CORS restrictions**: The `--cors-allowed-origins` flag controls which origins can make API requests

To resolve this, configure your tracking server with the appropriate flags. For example:

```bash
mlflow server --allowed-hosts "mlflow.company.com,localhost:*" \
              --cors-allowed-origins "https://app.company.com"
```

**Note**: These security options are only available with the default FastAPI-based server (uvicorn). They are
not supported when using Flask directly or with `--gunicorn-opts` or `--waitress-opts`.

Refer to the <ins>[Network Security Guide](/self-hosting/security/network)</ins> for detailed configuration options.

## Next Steps

Now that your environment is connected to MLflow, try the other GenAI quickstarts:

- **Instrument your app with tracing**: Follow the [quickstart](/genai/tracing/quickstart/python-openai) to instrument your first GenAI app
- **Evaluate your app's quality**: Use the [evaluation quickstart](/genai/eval-monitor/quickstart) to systematically test and improve your app's quality
