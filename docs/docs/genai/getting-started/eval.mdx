# Evaluating a GenAI App

This quickstart guides you through evaluating a GenAI application using MLflow Evaluation. We'll focus on a common use case: generating personalized sales emails based on customer data from a CRM.

This guide assumes you have MLflow installed and configured in your environment.

We will walk through the following steps:

1. **Create a new prompt and trace it**: Define an initial prompt for generating sales emails and trace its execution.
2. **Set up your evaluation criteria**: Define what makes a "good" email using custom scorers and guidelines.
3. **Create an evaluation dataset**: Prepare a dataset of customer information to test your email generation logic.
4. **Run evaluation**: Use MLflow to evaluate your prompt against the dataset and criteria.
5. **Review the results**: Analyze the evaluation output to understand areas for improvement.
6. **Change the prompt accordingly**: Modify your prompt based on the evaluation insights.
7. **Re-run evaluation**: Evaluate the new prompt to see if it performs better.
8. **Use the difference view**: Compare the results of the two evaluations to confirm improvements.

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a new prompt and trace it

First, we'll define a Python function `core_generate_email_logic` that takes customer data and a prompt template to generate an email. We'll use the `@mlflow.trace` decorator to automatically capture the execution details.

Create a file named `llm_utils.py` with the following content:

````python
import json
import os
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize OpenAI client

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

@mlflow.trace
def core_generate_email_logic(customer_data: dict, prompt_template: str, model: str):
    if not openai_client:
        raise RuntimeError("OpenAI client not available")

    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": prompt_template},
            {"role": "user", "content": json.dumps(customer_data)},
        ],
    )
    s = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Clean JSON
    clean_string = s
    if s.startswith("```json\\n") and s.endswith("\\n```"):
        clean_string = s[len("```json\\n") : -len("\\n```")]
    elif s.startswith("```") and s.endswith("```"):
        clean_string = s[3:-3]

    clean_string = clean_string.strip()
    email_json = json.loads(clean_string)
    return email_json
````

This file uses a provided prompt template and the `core_generate_email_logic` function. This function uses the OpenAI client to interact with GPT models and expects the LLM to return a JSON object containing the email's subject and body.

Now, create your main application file, let's call it `eval_app.py`. We'll start with an initial prompt template (`PROMPT_V1`).

```python
import json
import mlflow
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import functools
from mlflow.metrics.genai import make_genai_metric, faithfulness, relevance
from mlflow.entities import Feedback
from openai import OpenAI
from llm_utils import core_generate_email_logic

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

PROMPT_V1 = """You are an expert sales communication assistant for CloudFlow Inc. Your task is to generate a personalized, professional follow-up email for our sales representatives to send to their customers at the end of the day.

## INPUT DATA
You will be provided with a JSON object containing:
- Account information
- Recent activity data (meetings, product usage, support tickets)
- Sales representative details

## EMAIL REQUIREMENTS
Generate an email that follows these guidelines:

1. SUBJECT LINE:
- Engaging and attention-grabbing
- Include the company name if appropriate

2. GREETING:
- Address the main contact by first name
- Use a professional but friendly opening

3. BODY CONTENT:
- Begin with a brief mention of CloudFlow's recent improvements
- Reference the most recent meeting/interaction
- Provide updates on support tickets
- Highlight positive product usage trends
- Address any action items from previous meetings
- Include recommendations for additional features they should try
- Suggest scheduling a follow-up meeting soon

4. TONE AND STYLE:
- Professional but enthusiastic
- Show expertise by using industry terminology
- Include at least one customer success story
- Balance being informative with driving future business
- Personalized where possible
- Ensure email is comprehensive enough to cover all important points

5. CLOSING:
- Include an appropriate sign-off
- Use the sales rep's signature from the provided data
- Add a brief mention of an upcoming product release or feature

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide the complete email as JUST a JSON object that can be loaded via `json.loads()` (do not wrap the JSON in backticks) with:
- `subject_line`: Subject line
- `body`: Body content with appropriate spacing and formatting including the signature

Remember, this email should position the sales representative as a trusted advisor who can help the customer get maximum value from CloudFlow's solutions."""

# We will define the rest of the functions (load_input_data, scorers, evaluate_email_generation, etc.) in the next steps.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # For now, let's just test the core logic with a sample customer
    sample_customer_data = {
        "customer_info": {
            "account_name": "TestCorp",
            "main_contact_first_name": "Alex",
            "recent_meeting_summary": "Discussed Q3 performance and upcoming features.",
            "support_tickets": [
                {
                    "id": "TICKET-001",
                    "status": "Resolved",
                    "summary": "Login issue fixed.",
                }
            ],
            "product_usage_trends": "Increased usage of analytics module by 20%.",
            "action_items": ["Follow up on integration proposal."],
            "sales_rep": {
                "name": "Jane Doe",
                "title": "Senior Account Manager",
                "email": "jane.doe@cloudflow.com",
            },
        }
    }

    print("Generating email with PROMPT_V1...")
    generated_email_v1 = core_generate_email_logic(
        customer_data=sample_customer_data["customer_info"],
        prompt_template=PROMPT_V1,
        model="gpt-4",  # Or your chosen model
    )
    print(f"Subject: {generated_email_v1['subject_line']}")
    print(f"Body:\n{generated_email_v1['body']}")
```

:::important
Before running, ensure you have a `.env` file in your project root with your credentials as described in the [Tracing quickstart](/genai/getting-started/tracing/tracing-ide).
:::

Run `python eval_app.py`. This will generate an email using `PROMPT_V1` and print it. Because `core_generate_email_logic` is decorated with `@mlflow.trace`, a trace for this generation will be logged to your MLflow Experiment. You can navigate to the MLflow UI to view it.

## Step 2: Set up your evaluation criteria

Now, let's define how we'll measure the quality of the generated emails. We'll create custom metrics using MLflow's evaluation framework.
Add the following to your `eval_app.py`:

```python
# ... (imports and PROMPT_V1 definition from above) ...

# Define evaluation guidelines
guidelines = {
    "accuracy": """The response correctly references all factual information from the provided_info based on these rules:

- All factual information must be directly sourced from the provided data with NO fabrication
- Names, dates, numbers, and company details must be 100% accurate with no errors
- Meeting discussions must be summarized with the exact same sentiment and priority as presented in the data
- Support ticket information must include correct ticket IDs, status, and resolution details when available
- All product usage statistics must be presented with the same metrics provided in the data
- No references to CloudFlow features, services, or offerings unless specifically mentioned in the customer data
- AUTOMATIC FAIL if any information is mentioned that is not explicitly provided in the data""",
    "personalized": """The response demonstrates clear personalization based on the provided_info based on these rules:
- Email must begin by referencing the most recent meeting/interaction
- Immediately next, the email must address the customer's MOST pressing concern as evidenced in the data
- Content structure must be customized based on the account's health status (critical issues first for "Fair" or "Poor" accounts)
- Industry-specific language must be used that reflects the customer's sector
- Recommendations must ONLY reference features that are:
  a) Listed as "least_used_features" in the data, AND
  b) Directly related to the "potential_opportunity" field
- Relationship history must be acknowledged (new vs. mature relationship)
- Deal stage must influence communication approach (implementation vs. renewal vs. growth)
- AUTOMATIC FAIL if recommendations could be copied to another customer in a different situation""",
    "relevance": """The response prioritizes content that matters to the recipient in the provided_info based on these rules:
- Critical support tickets (status="Open (Critical)") must be addressed after the greeting, reference to the most recent interaction, any pleasantries, and references to closed tickets
  - it is ok if they name is slightly different as long as it is clearly the same issue as in the provided_info
- Time-sensitive action items must be addressed before general updates
- Content must be ordered by descending urgency as defined by:
  1. Critical support issues
  2. Action items explicitly stated in most recent meeting
  3. Upcoming renewal if within 30 days
  4. Recently resolved issues
  5. Usage trends and recommendations
- No more than ONE feature recommendation for accounts with open critical issues
- No mentions of company news, product releases, or success stories not directly requested by the customer
- No calls to action unrelated to the immediate needs in the data
- AUTOMATIC FAIL if the email requests a meeting without being tied to a specific action item or opportunity in the data""",
}

# Create custom evaluation metrics


def create_custom_metrics():
    accuracy_metric = make_genai_metric(
        name="accuracy",
        definition=guidelines["accuracy"],
        grading_prompt="Rate the accuracy of the email based on the provided guidelines. Score from 1-5.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        parameters={"temperature": 0.0},
        greater_is_better=True,
    )

    personalization_metric = make_genai_metric(
        name="personalization",
        definition=guidelines["personalized"],
        grading_prompt="Rate how well personalized the email is based on the provided guidelines. Score from 1-5.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        parameters={"temperature": 0.0},
        greater_is_better=True,
    )

    relevance_metric = make_genai_metric(
        name="relevance_custom",
        definition=guidelines["relevance"],
        grading_prompt="Rate the relevance of the email content based on the provided guidelines. Score from 1-5.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        parameters={"temperature": 0.0},
        greater_is_better=True,
    )

    return [accuracy_metric, personalization_metric, relevance_metric]


@scorer
def rep_name_in_email(inputs, outputs):
    """Check if the sales representative's name is included in the email."""
    # Ensure inputs["customer_info"] and outputs["body"] are present
    if (
        "customer_info" not in inputs
        or "sales_rep" not in inputs["customer_info"]
        or "name" not in inputs["customer_info"]["sales_rep"]
    ):
        return Feedback(
            name="rep_name_in_email",
            value=0,
            rationale="Missing sales_rep name in input data.",
        )
    if "body" not in outputs:
        return Feedback(
            name="rep_name_in_email", value=0, rationale="Missing email body in output."
        )

    return Feedback(
        name="rep_name_in_email",
        value=1
        if inputs["customer_info"]["sales_rep"]["name"] in outputs["body"]
        else 0,
        rationale=f"Checked for presence of '{inputs['customer_info']['sales_rep']['name']}' in email body.",
    )


# ... (PROMPT_V1 and main execution block)
```

Here we've defined:

- `guidelines`: A dictionary of detailed criteria for accuracy, personalization, and relevance.
- `Custom GenAI metrics`: using `make_genai_metric` that use LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate our guidelines.
- `rep_name_in_email`: A simple custom function that checks if the sales representative's name is present in the email body.

## Step 3: Create an evaluation dataset

MLflow Evaluation runs against a dataset. Let's create a function to load customer data from a JSONL file. Create a file named `input_data.jsonl` in a directory called `data` (i.e., `data/input_data.jsonl`) relative to your `eval_app.py` with sample customer data.

Example `data/input_data.jsonl`:

```json
{"account_name": "AlphaTech", "main_contact_first_name": "Sarah", "recent_meeting_summary": "Reviewed Q1 goals, discussed new AI module.", "support_tickets": [{"id": "TICKET-101", "status": "Open (Critical)", "summary": "System outage affecting all users."}], "product_usage_trends": "Stable", "action_items": ["Schedule follow-up demo for AI module."], "sales_rep": {"name": "John Smith", "title": "Key Account Manager", "email": "john.smith@cloudflow.com"}, "least_used_features": ["Advanced Reporting"], "potential_opportunity": "Expand reporting capabilities to track AI module ROI."}
{"account_name": "BetaSolutions", "main_contact_first_name": "Mike", "recent_meeting_summary": "Onboarding complete, positive feedback on UI.", "support_tickets": [], "product_usage_trends": "Rapid adoption of core features.", "action_items": ["Check in next month for feedback."], "sales_rep": {"name": "Emily White", "title": "Account Executive", "email": "emily.white@cloudflow.com"}, "least_used_features": ["Workflow Automation", "API Access"], "potential_opportunity": "Streamline internal processes with workflow automation."}
{"account_name": "Gamma Corp", "main_contact_first_name": "Lisa", "recent_meeting_summary": "Discussed renewal terms. Concerned about pricing.", "support_tickets": [{"id": "TICKET-105", "status": "Resolved", "summary": "Billing inquiry clarified."}], "product_usage_trends": "High usage, considering premium features.", "action_items": ["Send revised renewal proposal."], "sales_rep": {"name": "David Brown", "title": "Senior Account Manager", "email": "david.brown@cloudflow.com"}, "least_used_features": ["SSO Integration"], "potential_opportunity": "Enhance security with SSO for their enterprise plan."}
```

Now add the data loading function to `eval_app.py`:

```python
# ... (imports, guidelines, scorers, PROMPT_V1) ...


def load_input_data(file_path: str) -> list:
    """
    Load input data from a JSONL file.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the JSONL file containing customer data

    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing customer information
    """
    data = []
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            try:
                customer_data = json.loads(line)
                # Format for MLflow evaluation
                data.append({"customer_info": customer_data})
            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
                print(
                    f"Skipping line due to JSON decode error: {e} - Line: {line.strip()}"
                )
    return data


# ... (main execution block)
```

This function reads each line from `input_data.jsonl`, parses it as JSON, and formats it into the structure expected by `mlflow.genai.evaluate`.

## Step 4: Run evaluation

With the prompt, metrics, and data ready, we can define our prediction function and the main evaluation function.

Add the following to `eval_app.py`:

```python
# ... (imports, guidelines, metrics, PROMPT_V1, load_input_data) ...


def predict_fn(inputs):
    """
    Prediction function that uses core_generate_email_logic to generate emails.

    Args:
        inputs: Dictionary containing customer information under the key "customer_info".

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing generated email subject and body.
    """
    return core_generate_email_logic(
        customer_data=inputs["customer_info"],
        prompt_template=PROMPT_V1,  # We'll make this configurable later
        model="gpt-4",
    )


def evaluate_email_generation(prompt, model, data_path="data/input_data.jsonl"):
    """
    Evaluate email generation using MLflow's evaluation harness.

    Args:
        prompt: The prompt template string to evaluate.
        model: The model name to use for generation.
        data_path: Path to the JSONL file with input data.

    Returns:
        Evaluation results from MLflow.
    """
    # Load evaluation data
    eval_data = load_input_data(data_path)
    if not eval_data:
        print("Evaluation data is empty. Skipping evaluation.")
        return None

    # Create a prediction function with the specific prompt and model
    def model_predict_fn(inputs):
        return core_generate_email_logic(
            customer_data=inputs["customer_info"],
            prompt_template=prompt,
            model=model,
        )

    # Get custom metrics
    custom_metrics = create_custom_metrics()

    # Add built-in metrics
    all_metrics = custom_metrics + [faithfulness, relevance, rep_name_in_email]

    # Run evaluation
    return mlflow.genai.evaluate(
        predict_fn=model_predict_fn,
        data=eval_data[:5],  # Limit to first 5 for demo
        model_type="text",
        evaluators="default",
        scorers=all_metrics,
        experiment_id=mlflow.get_experiment_by_name("Default").experiment_id,
    )


def eval_v1():
    print("\nEvaluating PROMPT_V1...")
    results_v1 = evaluate_email_generation(prompt=PROMPT_V1, model="gpt-4")
    if results_v1:
        print("PROMPT_V1 Evaluation Results:")
        print(results_v1.metrics)
    else:
        print("Evaluation of PROMPT_V1 failed or was skipped.")
    return results_v1


# Update the main execution block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set up MLflow
    mlflow.set_experiment("Email Generation Evaluation")

    eval_results_v1 = eval_v1()
    # eval_v2() will be called later
```

The `predict_fn` adapts our `core_generate_email_logic` to the interface expected by `mlflow.genai.evaluate`. The `evaluate_email_generation` function:

1. Loads the evaluation data using `load_input_data`.
2. Creates a prediction function with the specified prompt and model.
3. Calls `mlflow.genai.evaluate`, passing our custom prediction function, data, and the list of custom metrics.

Run `python eval_app.py` again. This time, it will evaluate `PROMPT_V1` against `input_data.jsonl` using your defined metrics. The summary metrics will be printed. An MLflow Run will be created in your Experiment, containing detailed results, including per-row scores and the overall metrics.

## Step 5: Review the results

Navigate to your MLflow Experiment in the MLflow UI (typically at `http://localhost:5000`). Find the latest run.

Under the **Metrics** section, you'll see the aggregated scores from your custom metrics (e.g., `accuracy/score`, `personalization/score`, `relevance_custom/score`, `rep_name_in_email/score`).

Click on the **Artifacts** tab. You should find evaluation results that provide a detailed breakdown of how each input performed across all metrics.

Review these results. For `PROMPT_V1`, you might notice:

- Lower scores for `personalization` and `relevance_custom` because the prompt is quite generic.
- The `rep_name_in_email` score might be okay if the LLM consistently includes the signature.
- `faithfulness` might be reasonable, but the emails might not be strategically useful.

This analysis helps identify that `PROMPT_V1` needs to be more specific about personalization and prioritizing information.

## Step 6: Change the prompt accordingly

Based on the review, we'll use `PROMPT_V2`, which is designed to be more specific, focusing on personalization, conciseness, and actionable content.

Add the improved prompt and evaluation function to `eval_app.py`:

```python
# ... (previous code) ...

PROMPT_V2 = """You are an expert sales communication assistant for CloudFlow Inc. Your task is to generate a personalized, professional follow-up email for our sales representatives to send to their customers at the end of the day.

## INPUT DATA

You will be provided with a JSON object containing:

- Account information
- Recent activity data (meetings, product usage, support tickets)
- Sales representative details

## EMAIL REQUIREMENTS

Generate an email that follows these guidelines:

1. SUBJECT LINE:

- Concise and specific to the most important update or follow-up point
- Include the company name if appropriate

2. GREETING:

- Address the main contact by first name
- Use a professional but friendly opening

3. BODY CONTENT (prioritize in this order):

- Reference the most recent meeting/interaction and acknowledge key points discussed
- Discuss any pressing issues that are still open immediately afterwards
- Provide updates on any urgent or recently resolved support tickets
- Highlight positive product usage trends or achievements
- Address any specific action items from previous meetings
- Include personalized recommendations based on features listed as 'least_used_features' and directly related to the 'potential_opportunity' field.
  - Make sure these recommendations can NOT be copied to another customer in a different situation
  - No more than ONE feature recommendation for accounts with open critical issues
- Suggest clear and specific next steps
  - Only request a meeting if it can be tied to specific action items

4. TONE AND STYLE:

- Professional but conversational
- Concise paragraphs (2-3 sentences each)
- Use bullet points for lists or multiple items
- Balance between being informative and actionable
- Personalized to reflect the existing relationship
- Adjust formality based on the customer's industry and relationship history

5. CLOSING:

- Include an appropriate sign-off
- Use the sales rep's signature from the provided data
- No generic marketing language or overly sales-focused calls to action

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide the complete email as JUST a JSON object that can be loaded via `json.loads()` (do not wrap the JSON in backticks) with:

- `subject_line`: Subject line
- `body`: Body content with appropriate spacing and formatting including the signature

Remember, this email should feel like it was thoughtfully written by the sales representative based on their specific knowledge of the customer, not like an automated message."""


def eval_v2():
    print("\nEvaluating PROMPT_V2...")
    results_v2 = evaluate_email_generation(prompt=PROMPT_V2, model="gpt-4")
    if results_v2:
        print("PROMPT_V2 Evaluation Results:")
        print(results_v2.metrics)
    else:
        print("Evaluation of PROMPT_V2 failed or was skipped.")
    return results_v2


# Update the main execution block

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set up MLflow
    mlflow.set_experiment("Email Generation Evaluation")

    eval_results_v1 = eval_v1()
    eval_results_v2 = eval_v2()

    if eval_results_v1 and eval_results_v2:
        print("\nSuccessfully completed evaluations for V1 and V2.")
        # Next step will show how to compare these results in the UI.
```

## Step 7: Re-run evaluation

Run `python eval_app.py` one more time. This will now run evaluations for both `PROMPT_V1` and `PROMPT_V2`. Two new MLflow runs will be created.

Examine the metrics for the `PROMPT_V2` run. You should hopefully see improvements in scores like `personalization/score` and `relevance_custom/score` due to the more detailed instructions in `PROMPT_V2`.

## Step 8: Use the difference view to understand if it works

MLflow provides a UI to compare runs, which is extremely useful for seeing if changes (like our prompt update) led to improvements.

1. Go to your MLflow Experiment in the UI.
2. Select the two latest runs (one for `PROMPT_V1` eval, one for `PROMPT_V2` eval). You can identify them by their start times or by adding tags/names to your runs if you extend the script.
3. Click the **Compare** button.
4. In the comparison view, you can see metrics side-by-side. Look for improvements in your key metrics (`personalization/score`, `relevance_custom/score`, etc.).
5. You can also compare artifacts to see how the generated emails and their scores changed for specific customer inputs.

By comparing the evaluation results, you can concretely demonstrate that `PROMPT_V2` generates higher quality emails according to your defined criteria.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully used MLflow Evaluation to:

- Define prompts and trace their execution.
- Create custom quality criteria using metrics and LLM judges.
- Build an evaluation dataset.
- Run evaluations for different prompt versions.
- Analyze results and compare versions to demonstrate improvement.

From here, you can explore more advanced MLflow Evaluation features:

- Experiment with different built-in metrics like `toxicity`, `flesch_kincaid_grade_level`, etc.
- Create more sophisticated custom metrics for domain-specific evaluation criteria.
- Integrate evaluation into your CI/CD pipelines for continuous quality monitoring.
- Scale up your evaluation datasets for more comprehensive testing.
- Explore MLflow's model registry features for managing different versions of your GenAI applications.
