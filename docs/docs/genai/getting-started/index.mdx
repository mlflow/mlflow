## Why MLflow for GenAI?

### 🔍 **Complete Observability**

See exactly what's happening inside your AI applications. MLflow Tracing captures every LLM call, tool interaction, and decision point—turning black-box systems into transparent, debuggable workflows.

### 📊 **Automated Quality Assurance**

Stop guessing if your changes improve quality. MLflow's evaluation framework uses LLM judges and custom metrics to systematically test every iteration, ensuring consistent improvements.

### 🚀 **Framework Freedom**

Use LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, or any of the 15+ supported frameworks. MLflow integrates seamlessly with your existing tools while providing a unified platform for tracking and deployment.

### 💡 **Human-in-the-Loop Excellence**

Bridge the gap between AI and domain expertise. Collect structured feedback from users and experts to continuously refine your applications based on real-world usage.

## Start Building in Minutes

Follow our quickstart guides to experience MLflow's power for GenAI development. Each guide takes less than 15 minutes and demonstrates core capabilities you'll use every day.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- MLflow 3+ installed (`pip install --upgrade mlflow`)
- An MLflow tracking server (local or remote)

:::

### Connect Your Environment

Set up MLflow to work with your development environment, whether you're using a local setup, cloud platform, or managed service.

**What you'll learn:**

- Configure MLflow tracking URI
- Set up experiment tracking
- Connect to model registries

**[Learn how to connect your environment →](/genai/getting-started/connect-environment)**

---

### Collect App Instrumentation with Tracing

Add comprehensive observability to your GenAI application with just a few lines of code. Watch every prompt, retrieval, and tool call as it happens.

**What you'll learn:**

- Auto-instrumentation of popular frameworks (i.e., OpenAI, LangChain, and DSPy)
- Capture custom traces
- Debug complex AI workflows

**[Learn how to use Tracing in an IDE →](/genai/getting-started/tracing/tracing-ide)**

**[Learn how to use Tracing in a Notebook →](/genai/getting-started/tracing/tracing-notebook)**

---

### Evaluate Application Quality

Systematically test and improve your application using LLM judges and custom metrics. Move beyond manual testing to data-driven quality assurance.

**What you'll learn:**

- Create evaluation datasets
- Use LLM judges for quality metrics
- Compare model versions objectively
