## Start Building Production GenAI Applications

MLflow transforms GenAI development from complex instrumentation to simple, one-line integrations. See how easy it is to add comprehensive observability, evaluation, and deployment to your AI applications.

### Add Complete Observability in One Line

Transform any GenAI application into a fully observable system:

```python
import mlflow

# Enable automatic tracing for your framework
mlflow.openai.autolog()  # For OpenAI
mlflow.langchain.autolog()  # For LangChain
mlflow.llama_index.autolog()  # For LlamaIndex
mlflow.dspy.autolog()  # For DSPy

# Your existing code now generates detailed traces
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}],
)
# ✅ Automatically traced: tokens, latency, cost, full request/response
```

No code changes required. Every LLM call, tool interaction, and prompt execution is automatically captured with detailed metrics.

### Manage and Optimize Prompts Systematically

Register prompts and automatically optimize them with data-driven techniques:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.genai.optimize import OptimizerConfig, LLMParams

# Register an initial prompt
initial_prompt = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(
    name="math_tutor",
    template="Answer this math question: {{question}}. Provide a clear explanation.",
)

# Prepare training data for optimization
train_data = [
    {"question": "What is 15 + 27?", "expected": "42"},
    {"question": "Calculate 8 × 9", "expected": "72"},
    # ... more examples
]

# Automatically optimize the prompt using MLflow + DSPy
result = mlflow.genai.optimize_prompt(
    target_llm_params=LLMParams(model_name="openai/gpt-4o-mini"),
    prompt=initial_prompt,
    train_data=train_data,
    eval_data=train_data[:5],  # Hold-out evaluation set
    optimizer_config=OptimizerConfig(
        num_instruction_candidates=5,  # Try 5 different prompt variations
        max_few_shot_examples=3,  # Include up to 3 examples
    ),
)

# The optimized prompt is automatically registered as a new version of the original prompt
optimized_prompt = result.optimized_prompt
print(
    f"Optimization improved accuracy from {result.baseline_score:.2f} to {result.optimized_score:.2f}"
)
print(
    f"Optimized prompt registered as version {optimized_prompt.version} of '{optimized_prompt.name}'"
)

# Deploy the best-performing version
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Use the optimized prompt in your application
    model_info = mlflow.openai.log_model(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        task="llm/v1/completions",
        name="math_tutor_optimized",
        prompts=[optimized_prompt],  # Link optimized prompt to model
    )
# ✅ Data-driven prompt optimization + automatic versioning + deployment
```

Transform manual prompt engineering into systematic, data-driven optimization with automatic performance tracking.

### Prerequisites

Ready to get started? You'll need:

- Python 3.10+ installed
- MLflow 3.0+ (`pip install --upgrade mlflow`)
- For prompt optimization: DSPy (`pip install dspy`)
- API access to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
