# Quickstart

Follow these quickstart guides to start using MLflow for your GenAI app.

## Connect your environment

Set up your development environment to work with MLflow for GenAI applications.

- [Connect your environment](/genai/getting-started/connect-environment)

## Instrument your application using MLflow Tracing

MLflow Tracing helps you debug and iterate on your GenAI applications by capturing the entire execution flow, including prompts, retrievals, and tool calls. This allows you to monitor and improve the quality, cost, and latency of your application.

Based on your development environment, follow the appropriate quickstart below:

- [Tracing quickstart for Local IDE](/genai/getting-started/tracing/tracing-ide)
- [Tracing quickstart for Jupyter Notebook](/genai/getting-started/tracing/tracing-notebook)

## Evaluate your application's quality

MLflow empowers you to iteratively improve your GenAI application's quality by embedding evaluation directly into your development workflow. Systematically test changes to prompts, models, or application logic using `mlflow.evaluate()` with LLM judges and custom metrics.

- [Evaluation quickstart](/genai/getting-started/eval)

## Collect human feedback

Incorporate human insight by capturing domain expert and end-user feedback to understand desired application behavior and align your custom LLM-judge metrics with expert judgment.

- [Human feedback quickstart](/genai/getting-started/human-feedback)

## Next steps

After completing the quickstarts, explore these comprehensive tutorials:
