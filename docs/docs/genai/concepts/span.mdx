# Spans

## What is a Span?

The Span object is a fundamental building block in the [Trace](/genai/concepts/trace) data model. It is a container for the information about the individual steps of the trace, such as LLM calls, tool execution, retrieval, etc. Spans form a hierarchical tree structure within a single trace, which represents the execution flow of the trace.

For example, the above picture illustrates a set of spans that are organized in a tree structure in a trace. Each line represents a span, where the tree-structure is formed by the curly edges between lines.

## Span Object Schema

MLflow's Span object is designed to be compatible with the [OpenTelemetry Span spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces#spans). It is a dataclass object that is mostly same as the OpenTelemetry span object, but with some additional convenience accessors and methods to support GenAI use cases. When exported to OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, the Span object is serialized into the strict OpenTelemetry export format (OTLP).

| `attributes`    | `Dict[str, Any]`  | Attributes are metadata that are associated with a given step within your application. These are key-value pairs that provide insight into behavioral modifications for function and method calls.                                                            |
| `events`        | `List[SpanEvent]` | Events are a system-level property that is optionally applied to a span only if there was an issue during the execution of the span. These events contain information about exceptions that were thrown in the instrumented call, as well as the stack trace. |

## Span Attributes

Span attributes are key-value pairs that provide insight into behavioral modifications for function and method calls.

```python
span.set_attributes(
    {
        "ai.model.name": "o3-mini",
        "ai.model.version": "2024-01-01",
        "ai.model.provider": "openai",
        "ai.model.temperature": 0.7,
        "ai.model.max_tokens": 1000,
        "infrastructure.gpu.type": "A100",
        "infrastructure.memory.used_mb": 2048,
    }
)
```

## Span Types

Span types are a way to categorize spans within a trace. MLflow provides a set of predefined span types for common use cases, while also allowing you to set custom span types.

<TabsWrapper>
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="built-in" label="Built-in Types" default>
    | **Span Type**  | **Description**                                                                        |
    | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `"CHAT_MODEL"` | Represents a query to a chat model. This is a special case of an LLM interaction.      |
    | `"CHAIN"`      | Represents a chain of operations.                                                      |
    | `"AGENT"`      | Represents an autonomous agent operation.                                              |
    | `"TOOL"`       | Represents a tool execution (typically by an agent), such as querying a search engine. |
    | `"EMBEDDING"`  | Represents a text embedding operation.                                                 |
    | `"RETRIEVER"`  | Represents a context retrieval operation, such as querying a vector database.          |
    | `"PARSER"`     | Represents a parsing operation, transforming text into a structured format.            |
    | `"RERANKER"`   | Represents a re-ranking operation, ordering the retrieved contexts based on relevance. |
    | `"MEMORY"`     | Represents a memory operation, such as persisting context in a long-term memory db.    |
    | `"UNKNOWN"`    | A default span type that is used when no other span type is specified.                 |
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="usage" label="Setting Span Types">
    When you are using [automatic tracing](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic), the span type is automatically set by MLflow.
    To set a span type for manually created spans, you can pass the `span_type` parameter to the <APILink fn="mlflow.trace" /> decorator or <APILink fn="mlflow.start_span" /> context manager. When you are using [automatic tracing](/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/automatic), the span type is automatically set by MLflow.

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow.entities import SpanType


    # Setting a span type with the decorator
    @mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.RETRIEVER)
    def retrieve_documents(query: str):
        ...


    # Setting a span type with the context manager
    with mlflow.start_span(name="add", span_type=SpanType.TOOL) as span:
        span.set_inputs({"x": x, "y": y})
        z = x + y
        span.set_outputs({"z": z})


    # You can also define a custom span type string
    @mlflow.trace(span_type="ROUTER")
    def route_request(request):
        ...
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="search" label="Search Spans by Type">
    Span type is useful for searching and filtering particular spans in a large trace. MLflow supports both UI and programmatic span search by span type.

    **Searching spans by SDK:**

    ```python
    import mlflow
    from mlflow.entities import SpanType

    trace = mlflow.get_trace("<trace_id>")
    retriever_spans = trace.search_spans(span_type=SpanType.RETRIEVER)
    ```

    **Searching spans on UI:**

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabsWrapper>

## Specialized Span Schemas

MLflow has predefined types of spans, and certain span types have properties that are required in order to enable additional functionality within the UI and downstream tasks such as evaluation.

### Retriever Spans

The `RETRIEVER` span type is used for operations involving retrieving data from a data store (for example, querying documents from a vector store). The output of a `RETRIEVER` span is expected to be a list of documents.

Each document in the list should be a dictionary with the following structure:

**`page_content`** (str): The text content of the retrieved document chunk.

**`metadata`** (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]): A dictionary of additional metadata associated with the document. MLflow UI and evaluation metrics may specifically look for:

- `doc_uri` (str): A string URI for the document source
- `chunk_id` (str): A string identifier if the document is part of a larger chunked document

**`id`** (Optional[str]): An optional unique identifier for the document chunk itself.

#### Example Usage

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import SpanType, Document


def search_store(query: str) -> list[tuple[str, str]]:
    # Simulate retrieving documents (e.g., from a vector database)
    return [
        (
            "MLflow Tracing helps debug GenAI applications...",
            "docs/mlflow/tracing_intro.md",
        ),
        (
            "Key components of a trace include spans...",
            "docs/mlflow/tracing_datamodel.md",
        ),
        ("MLflow provides automatic instrumentation...", "docs/mlflow/auto_trace.md"),
    ]


@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.RETRIEVER)
def retrieve_relevant_documents(query: str):
    # Get documents from the search store
    docs = search_store(query)

    # Get the current active span (created by @mlflow.trace)
    span = mlflow.get_current_active_span()

    # Set the outputs of the span in accordance with the tracing schema
    outputs = [
        Document(page_content=doc, metadata={"doc_uri": uri}) for doc, uri in docs
    ]
    span.set_outputs(outputs)

    # Return the original format for downstream usage
    return docs


# Example usage
user_query = "MLflow Tracing benefits"
retrieved_docs = retrieve_relevant_documents(user_query)
```
