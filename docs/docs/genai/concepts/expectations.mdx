# Expectation Concepts

## What are Expectations?

**Expectations** in MLflow represent the ground truth or desired outputs for your GenAI application. They provide a standardized way to capture what your AI system should produce for a given input, establishing the reference point against which actual performance is measured.

Expectations serve as the foundation for systematic evaluation, enabling you to define clear quality standards and measure how well your application meets them across different scenarios and use cases.

## Core Structure

Expectations are always created by human experts who understand the correct behavior for your AI system. The <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Expectation">`Expectation`</APILink> object in MLflow provides a standard container for storing these ground truth values along with metadata about their creation. Expectations are associated with a Trace, or a particular Span in the Trace, allowing you to define expected behavior at any level of granularity.

## Expectation Object Schema

| Field                 | Type                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `trace_id`            | `str`                      | The ID of the trace that the expectation is attached to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `span_id`             | `Optional[str]`            | The ID of the span that the expectation is attached to, if it targets a specific operation within the trace. For example, you can set expectations for what documents should be retrieved in a RAG application.                                                                                                                                           |

## Expectation Examples

{
    "name": "expected_answer",
    "value": "The capital of France is Paris. It has been the capital since 987 AD and is home to over 2 million people.",
    "source": {
        "source_type": "HUMAN",
        "source_id": "geography_expert@company.com"
    },

        "category": "customer_complaint",
        "sentiment": "negative",
        "priority": "high",

    "source": {
        "source_type": "HUMAN",
        "source_id": "rag_specialist@company.com"
    },

## Key Differences from Feedback

While both Expectations and Feedback are types of assessments in MLflow, they serve distinct purposes:

| Aspect      | Expectations                      | Feedback                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Define what the AI should produce | Evaluate how well the AI performed      |
| **Timing**  | Set before or during development  | Applied after AI generates output       |
| **Source**  | Always from human experts         | Can be from humans, LLM judges, or code |
| **Content** | Ground truth values               | Quality scores, pass/fail judgments     |
| **Usage**   | Reference point for evaluation    | Actual evaluation results               |

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Define expectations that are clear and unambiguous. Avoid vague expectations that could be interpreted multiple ways.

2. **Consider Edge Cases**: Include expectations for edge cases and error scenarios, not just happy path examples.

3. **Version Your Standards**: Use metadata to track which version of guidelines or standards was used to create expectations.

4. **Target Appropriate Granularity**: Use span-level expectations when you need to validate specific operations (like retrieval or parsing) within a larger workflow.

5. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure multiple experts use the same criteria when defining expectations for similar scenarios.

## Integration with Evaluation

Expectations work hand-in-hand with MLflow's evaluation capabilities:

- **Automated Comparison**: Use expectations as the ground truth for automated evaluation metrics
- **Human Review**: Compare actual outputs against expectations during manual review
- **LLM Judge Evaluation**: Provide expectations as context to LLM judges for more accurate assessment
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor how well your system meets expectations over time
