# Feedback Concepts

This guide introduces the core concepts of feedback and assessment in MLflow's GenAI evaluation framework. Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively measuring and improving the quality of your GenAI applications.

## What is Feedback?

**Feedback** in MLflow represents the result of any quality assessment performed on your GenAI application outputs. It provides a standardized way to capture evaluations, whether they come from automated systems, LLM judges, or human reviewers.

Feedback serves as the bridge between running your application and understanding its quality, enabling you to systematically track performance across different dimensions like correctness, relevance, safety, and adherence to guidelines.

## Core Concepts

### Feedback Object

The **Feedback object** (also referred to as an **Assessment** in some contexts) is the fundamental building block of MLflow's evaluation system. It serves as a standardized container for the result of any quality check, providing a common language for assessment across different evaluation methods.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="structure" label="Feedback Structure" default>
    Every Feedback object contains three core components:

    **Name**: A string identifying the specific quality aspect being assessed

    Examples: `"correctness"`, `"relevance_to_query"`, `"is_safe"`, `"guideline_adherence_politeness"`

    **Value**: The actual result of the assessment, which can be:
    - Numeric scores (e.g., `0.0` to `1.0`, `1` to `5`)
    - Boolean values (`True`/`False`)
    - Categorical labels (e.g., `"PASS"`, `"FAIL"`, `"EXCELLENT"`)
    - Structured data (e.g., `{"score": 0.8, "confidence": 0.9}`)

    **Rationale**: A string explaining why the assessment resulted in the given value

    This explanation is crucial for transparency, debugging, and understanding evaluation behavior, especially for LLM-based assessments.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sources" label="Feedback Sources">
    Feedback can originate from multiple sources, each with different characteristics:

    **LLM-based Evaluations**: Automated assessments using language models as judges
    - Fast and scalable
    - Can evaluate complex, subjective criteria
    - Provide detailed reasoning in rationale

    **Programmatic Checks**: Rule-based or algorithmic evaluations
    - Deterministic and consistent
    - Fast execution
    - Good for objective, measurable criteria

    **Human Reviews**: Manual assessments from human evaluators
    - Highest quality for subjective evaluations
    - Slower and more expensive
    - Essential for establishing ground truth

    All feedback types are treated equally in MLflow and can be combined to provide comprehensive quality assessment.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="attachment" label="Trace Attachment">
    Feedback objects are attached to **MLflow Traces**, creating a direct connection between application execution and quality assessment:

    **Execution + Assessment**: Each trace captures how your application processed a request, while feedback captures how well it performed

    **Multi-dimensional Quality**: A single trace can have multiple feedback objects assessing different quality dimensions

    **Historical Analysis**: Attached feedback enables tracking quality trends over time and across different application versions

    **Debugging Context**: When quality issues arise, you can examine both the execution trace and the assessment rationale

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Assessment Dimensions

Feedback can evaluate various aspects of your GenAI application's performance:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="correctness" label="Correctness & Accuracy" default>
    **Factual Accuracy**: Whether the generated content contains correct information

    **Answer Completeness**: How thoroughly the response addresses the user's question

    **Logical Consistency**: Whether the reasoning and conclusions are sound

    Example feedback:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "factual_accuracy",
      "value": 0.85,
      "rationale": "The response correctly identifies 3 out of 4 key facts about MLflow, but incorrectly states the founding year."
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="relevance" label="Relevance & Context">
    **Query Relevance**: How well the response addresses the specific user question

    **Context Utilization**: Whether retrieved documents or provided context were used effectively

    **Topic Adherence**: Staying on-topic and avoiding irrelevant tangents

    Example feedback:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "relevance_to_query",
      "value": "HIGH",
      "rationale": "Response directly answers the user's question about MLflow features and provides relevant examples."
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="safety" label="Safety & Guidelines">
    **Content Safety**: Detecting harmful, inappropriate, or toxic content

    **Guideline Adherence**: Following specific organizational or ethical guidelines

    **Bias Detection**: Identifying unfair bias or discrimination in responses

    Example feedback:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "is_safe",
      "value": true,
      "rationale": "Content contains no harmful, toxic, or inappropriate material."
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="quality" label="Quality & Style">
    **Writing Quality**: Grammar, clarity, and coherence of the response

    **Tone Appropriateness**: Whether the tone matches the intended context

    **Helpfulness**: How useful the response is to the user

    Example feedback:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "helpfulness",
      "value": 4,
      "rationale": "Response provides clear, actionable information but could include more specific examples."
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Feedback Lifecycle

Understanding how feedback flows through your evaluation process:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="generation" label="Generation" default>
    **During Application Execution**: Traces are created as your GenAI application processes requests

    **Post-Execution Evaluation**: Feedback is generated by evaluating the trace data (inputs, outputs, intermediate steps)

    **Multiple Evaluators**: Different evaluation methods can assess the same trace, creating multiple feedback objects

    **Batch or Real-time**: Feedback can be generated immediately or in batch processes

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="attachment" label="Attachment">
    **Trace Association**: Each feedback object is linked to a specific trace using trace IDs

    **Persistent Storage**: Feedback is stored alongside trace data in MLflow's backend

    **Metadata Preservation**: All context about the evaluation method and timing is maintained

    **Version Tracking**: Changes to feedback or re-evaluations are tracked over time

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="aggregation" label="Aggregation">
    **Quality Metrics**: Individual feedback objects can be aggregated into overall quality scores

    **Trend Analysis**: Historical feedback enables tracking quality changes over time

    **Comparative Analysis**: Compare feedback across different model versions, prompts, or configurations

    **Reporting**: Generate quality reports and dashboards from aggregated feedback data
