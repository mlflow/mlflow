# Scorer Concepts

## What are Scorers?

**Scorers** in MLflow are evaluation functions that assess the quality of your GenAI application outputs. They provide a systematic way to measure performance across different dimensions like correctness, relevance, safety, and adherence to guidelines.

Scorers transform subjective quality assessments into measurable metrics, enabling you to track performance, compare models, and ensure your applications meet quality standards. They range from simple rule-based checks to sophisticated LLM judges that can evaluate nuanced aspects of language generation.

  }

## Scorer Output Structure

All scorers in MLflow produce standardized output that integrates seamlessly with the evaluation framework. Scorers return a <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Feedback" /> object containing:

| Field       | Type             | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | `str`            | Unique identifier for the scorer (e.g., "correctness", "safety")           |
| `value`     | `Any`            | The evaluation result - can be numeric, boolean, or categorical            |
| `rationale` | `Optional[str]`  | Explanation of why this score was given (especially useful for LLM judges) |
| `metadata`  | `Optional[dict]` | Additional information about the evaluation (confidence, sub-scores, etc.) |
| `error`     | `Optional[str]`  | Error message if the scorer failed to evaluate                             |

## Common Scorer Patterns

MLflow's scorer system is highly flexible, supporting everything from simple rule-based checks to sophisticated AI agents that analyze entire execution traces. The examples below demonstrate the breadth of evaluation capabilities available - from detecting inefficiencies in multi-step workflows to assessing text readability, measuring response latency, and ensuring output quality. Each pattern can be customized to your specific use case and combined with others for comprehensive evaluation.

## Judge Alignment

One of the most powerful features of MLflow scorers is the ability to **align LLM judges with human preferences**. This transforms generic evaluation models into domain-specific experts that understand your unique quality standards.

### How Alignment Works

Judge alignment uses human feedback to improve the accuracy and consistency of LLM-based scorers:

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges import make_judge
import mlflow

# Create an initial judge
quality_judge = make_judge(
    name="quality",
    instructions="Evaluate if {{ outputs }} meets quality standards for {{ inputs }}.",
    model="anthropic:/claude-opus-4-1-20250805",
)

# Collect traces with both judge assessments and human feedback
traces_with_feedback = mlflow.search_traces(
    experiment_ids=[experiment_id], max_results=20  # Minimum 10 required for alignment
)

# Align the judge with human preferences (uses default DSPy-SIMBA optimizer)
aligned_judge = quality_judge.align(traces_with_feedback)

# The aligned judge now better matches your team's quality standards
feedback = aligned_judge(inputs={"query": "..."}, outputs={"response": "..."})
```

### Key Benefits of Alignment

- **Domain Expertise**: Judges learn your specific quality criteria from expert feedback
- **Consistency**: Aligned judges apply standards uniformly across evaluations
- **Cost Efficiency**: Once aligned, smaller/cheaper models can match expert judgment
- **Continuous Improvement**: Re-align as your standards evolve

### The Plugin Architecture

MLflow's alignment system uses a plugin architecture, allowing you to create custom optimizers by extending the <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.judges.base.AlignmentOptimizer">AlignmentOptimizer</APILink> base class:

```python
from mlflow.genai.judges.base import AlignmentOptimizer


class CustomOptimizer(AlignmentOptimizer):
    def align(self, judge, traces):
        # Your custom alignment logic
        return improved_judge


# Use your custom optimizer
aligned_judge = quality_judge.align(traces, CustomOptimizer())
```

## Integration with MLflow Evaluation

Scorers are the building blocks of MLflow's evaluation framework. They integrate seamlessly with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`:

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Your test data
test_data = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {
            "inputs": {"question": "What is MLflow?"},
            "outputs": {
                "response": "MLflow is an open-source platform for ML lifecycle management."
            },
            "expectations": {
                "ground_truth": "MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle"
            },
        },
        {
            "inputs": {"question": "How do I track experiments?"},
            "outputs": {
                "response": "Use mlflow.start_run() to track experiments in MLflow."
            },
            "expectations": {
                "ground_truth": "Use mlflow.start_run() to track experiments"
            },
        },
    ]
)


# Your application (optional if data already has outputs)
def my_app(inputs):
    # Your model logic here
    return {"response": f"Answer to: {inputs['question']}"}


# Evaluate with multiple scorers
results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    data=test_data,
    # predict_fn is optional if data already has outputs
    scorers=[
        correctness_judge,  # LLM judge from above
        reading_level,  # Custom scorer from above
    ],
)

# Access evaluation metrics
print(f"Correctness: {results.metrics.get('correctness/mean', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Reading Level: {results.metrics.get('reading_level/mode', 'N/A')}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Scorer Type**
   - Use code-based scorers for objective, deterministic metrics
   - Use LLM judges for subjective qualities requiring understanding
   - Use Agent-as-a-Judge for evaluating complex multi-step processes

2. **Combine Multiple Scorers**
   - No single metric captures all aspects of quality
   - Use a portfolio of scorers to get comprehensive evaluation
   - Balance efficiency (fast code-based) with depth (LLM and Agent judges)

3. **Align with Human Judgment**
   - Validate that your scorers correlate with human quality assessments
   - Use human feedback to improve LLM and Agent judge instructions
   - Consider using human-aligned judges for critical evaluations

4. **Monitor Scorer Performance**
   - Track scorer execution time and costs
   - Monitor for scorer failures and handle gracefully
   - Regularly review scorer outputs for consistency
