# Feedback Concepts

## What is Feedback?

**Feedback** in MLflow represents the result of any quality assessment performed on your GenAI application outputs. It provides a standardized way to capture evaluations, whether they come from automated systems, LLM judges, or human reviewers.

Feedback serves as the bridge between running your application and understanding its quality, enabling you to systematically track performance across different dimensions like correctness, relevance, safety, and adherence to guidelines.

## Use Cases

    description: "Manual quality checks are important for ensuring the quality of your GenAI application. For example, you can attach a feedback to indicate the hallucination in the response and compare quality between different models."

## Core Structure

</div>

Feedback is often created by different sources, such as human annotators, LLM judges, or real user's feedback in the application. The <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Feedback">`Feedback`</APILink> object in MLflow is a standard container for storing these signals along with metadata to track
how they are created. Feedbacks are associated with a Trace, or a particular Span in the Trace.
