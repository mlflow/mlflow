# MLflow Runs Data Model for GenAI

In MLflow 3, **Runs** represent evaluation iterations of your GenAI application and are attached directly to Models as part of the model's evolution. Unlike earlier MLflow versions where runs lived under experiments, runs now capture specific evaluation sessions that test and validate model performance.

## Overview

A Run represents a single evaluation iteration of your GenAI model - think of it as a snapshot of how your model or application performed during a specific testing session.

## Runs as Model Evolution Snapshots

Each Run captures a specific moment in your model's development lifecycle:

        RC1[📈 Evaluation Metrics]
        RC2[📋 Test Dataset Used]

        RC5[🎯 Quality Scores]
    end

## Relationship to Other Entities

Runs connect your model development to systematic evaluation:

```mermaid

    subgraph ECOSYSTEM[🌟 Run Ecosystem]
        direction TB

        M[🤖 Model] --> R[📊 Run]
        R --> T[📝 Traces]
        R --> A[📊 Assessments]

        ED[📋 Evaluation Dataset] --> R
        S[🎯 Scorers] --> R

        R --> RM[📈 Run Metrics]
        R --> RR[📋 Run Results]
    end

    classDef modelStyle fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    classDef runStyle fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#0277bd,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
    classDef entityStyle fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    classDef resultStyle fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ef6c00,stroke-width:2px,color:#000

    class M modelStyle
    class R runStyle
    class T,A,ED,S entityStyle
    class RM,RR resultStyle
```

**Key relationships:**
- **Runs can link to Models**: Iterative model or app development is tracked through runs
- **Runs generate Traces**: Evaluation execution creates trace records
- **Runs produce Assessments**: Quality judgments on model performance
- **Runs use Datasets**: Systematic testing against curated examples
- **Runs apply Scorers**: Automated evaluation functions

## Common Run Types

Different types of evaluation iterations serve different purposes:

| Run Type | Purpose | When Used |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Development Run** | Initial model testing | During model development |
| **Validation Run** | Performance verification | Before deployment |
| **Benchmark Run** | Comparative analysis | Against baseline models |
| **Production Run** | Live performance check | Post-deployment validation |
| **A/B Test Run** | Variant comparison | Testing model alternatives |

## Benefits of Model-Attached Runs

The MLflow 3 approach of attaching runs to models provides:

- **🎯 Model-Centric Organization**: Evaluation history travels with the model
- **📈 Evolution Tracking**: Clear progression of model performance over time
- **🔍 Focused Analysis**: Evaluation results directly tied to specific model versions
- **🚀 Simplified Workflows**: Natural connection between model development and testing

This model-centric approach makes it easier to understand how your GenAI application has evolved and which evaluation iterations led to improvements or regressions.
