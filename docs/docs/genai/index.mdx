## Observability

Debug and iterate on GenAI applications using MLflow's tracing, which captures your app's entire execution, including prompts, retrievals and tool calls.
MLflow's open-source, OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing SDK helps avoid vendor lock-in.

</CardGroup>

## Evaluations

Accurately measure free-form language with LLM judges by utilizing LLM-as-a-judge metrics, mimicking human expertise, to assess and enhance GenAI quality. Access pre-built judges for common metrics like hallucination or relevance, or develop custom judges tailored to your business needs and expert insights.

## Prompt Management & Optimization

Version, compare, iterate on, and discover prompt templates directly through the MLflow UI. Reuse prompts across multiple versions of your agent or application code, and view rich lineage identifying which versions are using each prompt.
