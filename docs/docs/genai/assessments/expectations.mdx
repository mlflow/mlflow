# Ground Truth Expectations

MLflow Expectations provide a systematic way to capture ground truth - the correct or desired outputs that your AI should produce. By establishing these reference points, you create the foundation for meaningful evaluation and continuous improvement of your GenAI applications.

For complete API documentation and implementation details, see the <APILink fn="mlflow.log_expectation" /> reference.

## What are Expectations?

[Expectations](/genai/tracing/concepts/expectations) define the "gold standard" for what your AI should produce given specific inputs. They represent the correct answer, desired behavior, or ideal output as determined by domain experts. Think of expectations as the answer key against which actual AI performance is measured.

Unlike [feedback](/genai/assessments/feedback) that evaluates what happened, expectations establish what should happen. They're always created by humans who have the expertise to define correct outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before using the <APILink fn="mlflow.log_expectation">Expectations API</APILink>, ensure you have:

- MLflow 3.2.0 or later installed
- An active MLflow tracking server or local tracking setup
- Traces that have been logged from your GenAI application to an MLflow Experiment

## Step-by-Step Guides

### Add Ground Truth Annotation via UI

The MLflow UI provides an intuitive way to add expectations directly to traces. This approach is ideal for domain experts who need to define ground truth without writing code, and for collaborative annotation workflows where multiple stakeholders contribute different perspectives.

<WorkflowSteps
  steps={[
    {
      icon: MousePointer,
      title: "Navigate to your experiment",
      description: "Select the trace containing the interaction you want to annotate"
    },
    {
      icon: Plus,
      title: "Click \"Add Assessment\" button",
      description: "Access the assessment creation form on the trace detail page"
    },
    {
      icon: ListCheck,
      title: "Select \"Expectation\" from dropdown",
      description: "Choose Assessment Type to define ground truth rather than feedback"
    },
    {
      icon: Type,
      title: "Enter a descriptive name",
      description: "Use clear names like \"expected_answer\", \"correct_classification\", or \"expected_documents\""
    },
    {
      icon: Settings,
      title: "Choose the appropriate data type",
      description: "Select String for text, JSON for structured data, Boolean for binary expectations"
    },
    {
      icon: FileInput,
      title: "Enter the ground truth value",
      description: "Define what the AI should have produced for this specific input"
    },
    {
      icon: MessageSquare,
      title: "Add rationale explaining correctness",
      description: "Document why this is the correct or expected output for future reference"
    },
    {
      icon: Target,
      title: "Click \"Create\" to record expectation",
      description: "Save your ground truth annotation to establish the quality baseline"
    }
  ]}
  screenshot={{
    src: AddExpectationImageUrl,
    alt: "Add Expectation"
  }}
/>

The expectation will be immediately attached to the trace, establishing the ground truth reference for future evaluation.

### Log Ground Truth via API

Use the programmatic <APILink fn="mlflow.log_expectation" /> API when you need to automate expectation creation, integrate with existing annotation tools, or build custom ground truth collection workflows.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="single" label="Single Annotations" default>

Programmatically create expectations for systematic ground truth collection:

**1. Set up your annotation environment:**

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import AssessmentSource
from mlflow.entities.assessment_source import AssessmentSourceType

# Define your domain expert source
expert_source = AssessmentSource(
    source_type=AssessmentSourceType.HUMAN, source_id="domain_expert@company.com"
)
```

**2. Create expectations for different data types:**

```python
def log_factual_expectation(trace_id, question, correct_answer):
    """Log expectation for factual questions."""
    mlflow.log_expectation(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        name="expected_factual_answer",
        value=correct_answer,
        source=expert_source,
        metadata={
            "question": question,
            "expectation_type": "factual",
            "confidence": "high",
            "verified_by": "subject_matter_expert",
        },
    )


def log_structured_expectation(trace_id, expected_extraction):
    """Log expectation for structured data extraction."""
    mlflow.log_expectation(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        name="expected_extraction",
        value=expected_extraction,
        source=expert_source,
        metadata={
            "expectation_type": "structured",
            "schema_version": "v1.0",
            "annotation_guidelines": "company_extraction_standards_v2",
        },
    )


def log_behavioral_expectation(trace_id, expected_behavior):
    """Log expectation for AI behavior patterns."""
    mlflow.log_expectation(
        trace_id=trace_id,
        name="expected_behavior",
        value=expected_behavior,
        source=expert_source,
        metadata={
            "expectation_type": "behavioral",
            "behavior_category": "customer_service",
            "compliance_requirement": "company_policy_v3",
        },
    )
```

**3. Use the functions in your annotation workflow:**

```python
# Example: Annotating a customer service interaction
trace_id = "tr-customer-service-001"

# Define what the AI should have said
factual_answer = "Your account balance is $1,234.56 as of today."
log_factual_expectation(trace_id, "What is my account balance?", factual_answer)

# Define expected data extraction
expected_extraction = {
    "intent": "account_balance_inquiry",
    "account_type": "checking",
    "urgency": "low",
    "requires_authentication": True,
}
log_structured_expectation(trace_id, expected_extraction)

# Define expected behavior
expected_behavior = {
    "should_verify_identity": True,
    "tone": "professional_helpful",
    "should_offer_additional_help": True,
    "escalation_required": False,
}
log_behavioral_expectation(trace_id, expected_behavior)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="batch" label="Batch Annotations">

For large-scale ground truth collection, use batch annotation:

**1. Define the batch annotation function:**

```python
def annotate_batch_expectations(annotation_data):
    """Annotate multiple traces with ground truth expectations."""
    for item in annotation_data:
        try:
            mlflow.log_expectation(
                trace_id=item["trace_id"],
                name=item["expectation_name"],
                value=item["expected_value"],
                source=AssessmentSource(
                    source_type=AssessmentSourceType.HUMAN,
                    source_id=item["annotator_id"],
                ),
                metadata={
                    "batch_id": item["batch_id"],
                    "annotation_session": item["session_id"],
                    "quality_checked": True,
                },
            )
            print(f"✓ Annotated {item['trace_id']}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"✗ Failed to annotate {item['trace_id']}: {e}")
```

**2. Prepare your annotation data:**

```python
# Example batch annotation data
batch_data = [
    {
        "trace_id": "tr-001",
        "expectation_name": "expected_answer",
        "expected_value": "Paris is the capital of France",
        "annotator_id": "expert1@company.com",
        "batch_id": "geography_qa_batch_1",
        "session_id": "session_2024_01_15",
    },
    {
        "trace_id": "tr-002",
        "expectation_name": "expected_answer",
        "expected_value": "The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s",
        "annotator_id": "expert2@company.com",
        "batch_id": "physics_qa_batch_1",
        "session_id": "session_2024_01_15",
    },
]
```

**3. Execute batch annotation:**

```python
annotate_batch_expectations(batch_data)
```

## Expectation Annotation Workflows

Different stages of your AI development lifecycle require different approaches to expectation annotation. The following workflows help you systematically create and maintain ground truth expectations that align with your development process and quality goals.

<ConceptOverview concepts={[

    title: "Collaborative Annotation",
    description: "Use team-based annotation where domain experts define initial expectations, review committees validate and refine, and consensus building resolves disagreements."
  }
]} />

## Best Practices

### Be Specific and Measurable

Vague expectations lead to inconsistent evaluation. Define clear, specific criteria that can be objectively verified.

### Document Your Reasoning

Use metadata to explain why an expectation is defined a certain way:

```python
mlflow.log_expectation(
    trace_id=trace_id,
    name="expected_diagnosis",
    value={
        "primary": "Type 2 Diabetes",
        "risk_factors": ["obesity", "family_history"],
        "recommended_tests": ["HbA1c", "fasting_glucose"],
    },
    metadata={
        "guideline_version": "ADA_2024",
        "confidence": "high",
        "based_on": "clinical_presentation_and_history",
    },
    source=AssessmentSource(
        source_type=AssessmentSourceType.HUMAN, source_id="endocrinologist@hospital.org"
    ),
)
```

### Maintain Consistency

Use standardized naming and structure across your expectations to enable meaningful analysis and comparison.

## Managing Expectations

Once you've defined expectations for your traces, you may need to retrieve, update, or delete them to maintain accurate ground truth data.

### Retrieving Expectations

Retrieve specific expectations to analyze your ground truth data:

```python
# Get a specific expectation by ID
expectation = mlflow.get_assessment(
    trace_id="tr-1234567890abcdef", assessment_id="a-0987654321abcdef"
)

# Access expectation details
name = expectation.name
value = expectation.value
source_type = expectation.source.source_type
metadata = expectation.metadata if hasattr(expectation, "metadata") else None
```

### Updating Expectations

Update existing expectations when ground truth needs refinement:

```python
from mlflow.entities import Expectation

# Update expectation with corrected information
updated_expectation = Expectation(
    name="expected_answer",
    value="The capital of France is Paris, located in the Île-de-France region",
)

mlflow.update_assessment(
    trace_id="tr-1234567890abcdef",
    assessment_id="a-0987654321abcdef",
    assessment=updated_expectation,
)
```

### Deleting Expectations

Remove expectations that were logged incorrectly:

```python
# Delete specific expectation
mlflow.delete_assessment(
    trace_id="tr-1234567890abcdef", assessment_id="a-5555666677778888"
)
```

## Integration with Evaluation

Expectations are most powerful when combined with systematic evaluation:

1. **Automated scoring** against expectations
2. **Human feedback** on expectation achievement
3. **Gap analysis** between expected and actual
4. **Performance metrics** based on expectation matching
