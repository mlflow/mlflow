# Phase 1: Building and Iteratively Improving Your GenAI App

This phase covers the initial development of your GenAI application, from building your first proof-of-concept through iterative improvement based on feedback from test users. You'll establish the foundation for systematic development, debugging, and quality improvement that will serve you throughout your application's lifecycle.

## Overview

During Phase 1, you'll face several key challenges as you develop and refine your GenAI application:

| Challenge | Solution | Key Benefit |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Debug Complex Logic** | MLflow Tracing | Complete observability across development and production |
| **Use Real User Queries** | Trace Collection & Search | Test with realistic usage patterns |
| **Track Quality Feedback** | Feedback APIs & UI | Systematic quality assessment |
| **Get Expert Input** | Review App Integration | Authoritative validation from domain experts |
| **Iterate on Prompts** | Evaluation Harness | Side-by-side comparison of variants |

## Challenge 1: Debug Application Logic

### The Problem

Even simple applications with a single prompt can be difficult to debug. As your app grows beyond basic prompts to include external data sources (vector databases, APIs) and tools, debugging becomes increasingly complex:

- **Prompt Construction**: What input data was used for each variable in the prompt template?
- **Performance Issues**: Is latency due to the LLM or a slow API call?
- **User Issue Reproduction**: Understanding exactly how user input was processed through each step
- **Local vs Production**: Seeing the same debugging information in both environments

### Solution: Implement MLflow Tracing

MLflow Tracing provides complete observability into your application's logic, latency, and cost. The same tracing works identically in development and production environments.

### Implementation Benefits

Beyond immediate debugging capabilities, implementing tracing enables future capabilities:
- **Quality feedback attachment** to specific execution traces
- **Performance optimization** through detailed timing analysis
- **Cost tracking** across different configurations
- **Production monitoring** with the same observability tools

## Challenge 2: Leverage Test User Queries

### The Problem

During development, beta testers provide valuable real-world examples that reveal:
- **Natural language patterns**: How users actually phrase questions
- **Usage scenarios**: Realistic use cases you hadn't considered
- **Quality gaps**: Areas where your application underperforms
- **Edge cases**: Unusual but valid user inputs

You need a systematic way to capture and reuse these examples for testing improvements.

### Solution: Systematic Query Collection

MLflow Tracing automatically captures every user interaction with complete context. Use the MLflow Trace UI and SDK to browse, select, and reuse valuable examples.

### Key Capabilities

- **Automatic capture** of all user interactions during beta testing
- **Rich context** including inputs, outputs, timing, and metadata
- **Programmatic access** via `search_traces` SDK for notebook/IDE integration
- **Direct reuse** of `trace.inputs` for validation testing

## Challenge 3: Track Quality Feedback

### The Problem

Even with a small group of test users, you need reliable ways to:
- **Capture user feedback** on response quality
- **Log your own observations** during development iteration
- **Identify problem patterns** across different types of queries
- **Guide improvement priorities** based on systematic feedback collection

### Solution: Integrated Feedback Collection

MLflow's feedback system allows you to attach quality assessments directly to traces through multiple channels.

```

### Feedback Collection Methods

- **In-application UI**: Thumbs up/down or free-text feedback captured via `log_feedback` API
- **MLflow Trace UI**: Direct annotation of traces during development
- **Review App**: Built-in chat UI for Databricks deployments with automatic feedback integration

## Challenge 4: Get Domain Expert Input

### The Problem

During development, you often encounter situations where you need authoritative input:
- **Correct answers** for queries outside your expertise
- **Validation** of whether negative user feedback is justified
- **Priority assessment** for different types of issues
- **Business stakeholder input** on acceptable response quality

Domain experts need an accessible way to provide structured feedback without technical complexity.

### Solution: MLflow Review App

The Review App enables you to share specific traces with domain experts for structured review and feedback collection.

```

### Review App Features

- **User-friendly interface** that domain experts can use without technical knowledge
- **Custom questions** tailored to your specific review needs
- **Automatic integration** with original traces for unified feedback view
- **Structured collection** of expert assessments and recommendations

## Challenge 5: Systematic Prompt Iteration

### The Problem

When iterating on prompts and code changes to improve quality, you need:
- **Systematic testing** of multiple variations against the same inputs
- **Side-by-side comparison** to quickly identify the best performing version
- **Version tracking** to promote successful changes to production
- **Debugging capability** to understand why specific versions succeeded or failed
- **Expert validation** when needed to confirm quality improvements

Manual testing of variations is time-consuming and error-prone.

### Solution: MLflow Evaluation Harness

The Evaluation Harness enables systematic testing and comparison of multiple application variants with minimal setup effort.
