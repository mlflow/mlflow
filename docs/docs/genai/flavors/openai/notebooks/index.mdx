# MLflow OpenAI Flavor - Tutorials and Guides

Below, you will find a number of guides that focus on different ways that you can leverage the power of the _openai_ library, leveraging MLflow's
APIs for tracking and inference capabilities.

The diagram below shows the basic scope of the level of complexity that the tutorials cover.

## Introductory Tutorial

<CardGroup>
  <PageCard
    headerText="OpenAI Quickstart"
    link="/genai/flavors/openai/notebooks/openai-quickstart"
    text="Learn the very basics of using the OpenAI package with MLflow with some simple prompt engineering and a fun use case to get started with this powerful integration."
  />

</CardGroup>

## Advanced Tutorials

In these tutorials, the topics cover applied interactions with OpenAI models, leveraging custom Python Models to enhance the functionality beyond what is
possible with the basic prompt-based interaction from the introductory tutorial.
If you're new to this flavor, please start with the Introductory Tutorial above, as it has information about environment configurations that you'll need
to understand in order to get the notebooks in this section to work.
