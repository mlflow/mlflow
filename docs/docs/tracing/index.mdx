# MLflow Tracing for LLM Observability

**MLflow Tracing** is a feature that enhances LLM observability in your Generative AI (GenAI) applications by capturing detailed information about the execution of your application's services.
Tracing provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.

## Introduction to Observability and Traces

:::tip

If you are new to the tracing or observability concepts, we recommend starting with the [Tracing Concepts](./concept) page.

          #### Complete Debugging Experience in Your IDE or Notebook

          MLflow's tracing capabilities provide deep insights into what happens beneath the abstractions of GenAI libraries, helping you precisely identify where issues occur.

          You can navigate traces seamlessly **within** your preferred IDE or notebook, eliminating the hassle of switching between multiple tabs or searching through an overwhelming list of traces.

        #### Building a High-Quality Evaluation Dataset

        Evaluating the performance of your GenAI application is crucial, but creating a reliable evaluation dataset can be challenging. Traces serve as a rich data source, helping you build high-quality datasets with precise metrics for internal components like retrievers and tools.

        When combined with [MLflow LLM Evaluation](/llms/evaluate), MLflow offers a seamless experience for assessing and improving your application‚Äôs performance.

        #### Root Cause Analysis for Improved Quality

        After evaluating your model using [MLflow LLM Evaluation](/llms/evaluate), you can explore auto-generated traces during the evaluation run to identify root causes of quality issues ‚Äî for instance, insufficiently retrieved documents.

        Traces empower you to analyze issues in detail and iterate quickly to enhance the quality of your application.

## Tracing with SDK

In addition to the one-line auto tracing experience, MLflow offers Python SDK for manually instrumenting
you code and manipulating traces.

1. [Instrument a function with `@mlflow.trace` decorator.](sdk/manual-instrumentation.mdx#decorator)
2. [Instrument any block of code using `mlflow.start_span` context manager.](sdk/manual-instrumentation.mdx#context-manager)
3. [Grouping or annotating traces using a tag.](sdk/how-to#trace-tags)
4. [Disabling trace globally.](sdk/how-to#disabling-traces)

Refer to the [Tracing How To Guide](sdk/how-to) for more details about the SDK.

## Query Traces

Trace data are useful for various downstream tasks, such as creating an evaluation dataset for offline evaluation and production monitoring. MLflow provides several APIs to search and retrieve recorded traces programmatically. See [Searching and Retrieving Traces](sdk/search.mdx) for more details.

## Tracing in Production

MLflow Tracing is production ready. Read [Production Tracing](production.mdx) for the guidance to use it for monitoring models in production and various backend options.

:::note
MLflow Tracing support is available with the **MLflow 2.14.0** release.
