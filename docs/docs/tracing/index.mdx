# MLflow Tracing for LLM Observability

**MLflow Tracing** is a feature that enhances LLM observability in your Generative AI (GenAI) applications by capturing detailed information about the execution of your application's services.
Tracing provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.

          #### Complete Debugging Experience in Your IDE or Notebook

          MLflow's tracing capabilities provide deep insights into what happens beneath the abstractions of GenAI libraries, helping you precisely identify where issues occur.

          You can navigate traces seamlessly **within** your preferred IDE or notebook, eliminating the hassle of switching between multiple tabs or searching through an overwhelming list of traces.

        #### Building a High-Quality Evaluation Dataset

        Evaluating the performance of your GenAI application is crucial, but creating a reliable evaluation dataset can be challenging. Traces serve as a rich data source, helping you build high-quality datasets with precise metrics for internal components like retrievers and tools.

        When combined with [MLflow LLM Evaluation](/llms/llm-evaluate), MLflow offers a seamless experience for assessing and improving your application’s performance.

        #### Root Cause Analysis for Improved Quality

        After evaluating your model using [MLflow LLM Evaluation](/llms/llm-evaluate), you can explore auto-generated traces during the evaluation run to identify root causes of quality issues — for instance, insufficiently retrieved documents.

        Traces empower you to analyze issues in detail and iterate quickly to enhance the quality of your application.

        #### Monitor Applications with Your Favorite Observability Stack

        Machine learning projects don’t end with the first launch. Continuous monitoring and incremental improvement are critical to long-term success.

        You can put MLflow into your existing observability stack as well. MLflow can export traces to any **OpenTelemetry**-compatible storage, including Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, and more.
        Refer to [Export Traces to Other Services](/tracing/production#opentelemetry-collector) for more details.

The following is the simplest example of MLflow Tracing with OpenAI Python SDK:

```python
import mlflow
import openai

# Enable MLflow automatic tracing for OpenAI with one line of code!
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Use OpenAI Python SDK as usual
openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a chatbot."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like today?"},
    ],
)

# Then go to MLflow UI (if not started, run `mlflow ui` in your terminal) to see the trace!
```

## Automatic Tracing

MLflow Tracing is integrated with various GenAI libraries and provide **one-line automatic tracing** experience for each library (and the combination of them!). Click on the icon below to see detailed examples to integrate MLflow with your favorite library.

## Manual Tracing

In addition to the one-line auto tracing experience, MLflow offers Python SDK for manually instrumenting
you code and manipulating traces.

1. [Instrument a function with `@mlflow.trace` decorator.](/tracing/api/manual-instrumentation#decorator)
2. [Instrument any block of code using `mlflow.start_span` context manager.](/tracing/api/manual-instrumentation#context-manager)
3. [Grouping or annotating traces using a tag.](/tracing/api/how-to#setting-trace-tags)
4. [Disabling trace globally.](/tracing/api/how-to#disabling-traces)

Refer to the [Tracing How To Guide](/tracing/api/how-to) for more details about the SDK.


## Reviewing Traces


MLflow Traces can be reviewed in several ways:

1. **MLflow UI**: The MLflow UI provides a rich interface for exploring traces. You can view traces for a specific experiment, run, [search and filter traces](/tracing/api/search) based on various criteria. You can start the UI by running `mlflow ui` in your terminal and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: The trace UI is also available within Jupyter notebooks! The trace UI will automatically be displayed when a cell generates a trace, eliminating the need to switch between the notebook and web browser. See the [Jupyter Notebook Integration](/tracing/api/how-to#render-trace-inside-jupyter-notebook) for more details.



## Query Traces

Trace data are useful for various downstream tasks, such as creating an evaluation dataset for offline evaluation and production monitoring. MLflow provides several APIs to search and retrieve recorded traces programmatically. See [Searching and Retrieving Traces](/tracing/api/search) for more details.

## Tracing in Production

MLflow Tracing is production ready. Read [Production Tracing](/tracing/production) for the guidance to use it for monitoring models in production and various backend options.

:::note
MLflow Tracing support is available with the **MLflow 2.14.0** release.
