# (Advanced) Low-level Client APIs

The <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient">`MlflowClient`</APILink> class provides a set of low-level APIS for fine-grained control over creating, manipulating, and retrieving traces.

:::warning
We recommend using the client APIs ONLY when the high-level APIs like `@mlflow.trace` and `mlflow.start_span` do not satisfy your requirements. See [this page](/tracing/api/manual-instrumentation.mdx) for the usage of those high-level APIs.
:::

### Starting a Trace

Unlike with the high-level APIs, the MLflow Trace Client API requires that you explicitly start a trace before adding child spans. This initial API call
starts the root span for the trace, providing a context request_id that is used for associating subsequent spans to the root span.

To start a new trace, use the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.start_trace" /> method. This method creates a new trace and returns the root span object.

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Start a new trace
root_span = client.start_trace("my_trace")

# The request_id is used for creating additional spans that have a hierarchical association to this root span
request_id = root_span.request_id
```

### Adding a Child Span

Once a trace is started, you can add child spans to it with the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.start_span" /> API. Child spans allow you to break down the trace into smaller, more manageable segments,
each representing a specific operation or step within the overall process.

```python
# Create a child span
child_span = client.start_span(
    name="child_span",
    request_id=request_id,
    parent_id=root_span.span_id,
    inputs={"input_key": "input_value"},
    attributes={"attribute_key": "attribute_value"},
)
```

### Ending a Span

After performing the operations associated with a span, you must end the span explicitly using the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.end_span" /> method. Make note of the two required fields
that are in the API signature:

- **request_id**: The identifier associated with the root span
- **span_id**: The identifier associated with the span that is being ended

In order to effectively end a particular span, both the root span (returned from calling `start_trace`) and the targeted span (returned from calling `start_span`)
need to be identified when calling the `end_span` API.
The initiating `request_id` can be accessed from any parent span object's properties.

:::note
Spans created via the Client API will need to be terminated manually. Ensure that all spans that have been started with the `start_span` API
have been ended with the `end_span` API.
:::

```python
# End the child span
client.end_span(
    request_id=child_span.request_id,
    span_id=child_span.span_id,
    outputs={"output_key": "output_value"},
    attributes={"custom_attribute": "value"},
)
```

### Ending a Trace

To complete the trace, end the root span using the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.end_trace" /> method. This will also ensure that all associated child
spans are properly ended.

```python
# End the root span (trace)
client.end_trace(
    request_id=request_id,
    outputs={"final_output_key": "final_output_value"},
    attributes={"token_usage": "1174"},
)
```

### Other APIs

The MLflow client exposes several other APIs for interacting with trace data. Refer to the [how-to guide](http://localhost:3000/tracing/sdk/how-to) to learn more.
