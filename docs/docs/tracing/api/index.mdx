# MLflow Tracing SDK

This section of the docs contains more details about some of MLflow Tracing's features. Please visit the following subpages for more information:

- [**Manual Trace Instrumentation**](/tracing/api/manual-instrumentation). While automatic tracing is the most convenient way to get started, MLflow has several APIs that allow you to manually instrument your GenAI application and custom Python code.
- [**Querying Traces**](/tracing/api/search). Learn about how to query and filter your logged traces.
- [**Tracing SDK How-to Guides**](/tracing/api/how-to). This page contains several quick walkthroughs of important MLflow Tracing features. Learn how to [set trace tags](/tracing/api/how-to#setting-trace-tags), [delete traces](http://localhost:3000/tracing/api/how-to#delete-traces), and more! 
- [**Low-level Client APIs**](/tracing/api/client). This page covers low level client APIs for tracing that provide more fine-grained control over span creation and termination.
