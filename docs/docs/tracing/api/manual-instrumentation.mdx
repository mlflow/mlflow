# Manual Tracing

In addition to the [Auto Tracing](/tracing/#automatic-tracing) integrations, you can instrument your Python code using the MLflow Tracing SDK. This is especially useful when you need to instrument your custom Python code.

## Decorator

The <APILink fn="mlflow.trace">`@mlflow.trace`</APILink> decorator allows you to create a span for any function. This approach provides a simple yet effective way to add tracing to your code with minimal effort:

- MLflow detects the **parent-child relationships** between functions, making it compatible with auto-tracing integrations.
- Captures **exceptions** during function execution and records them as span events.
- Automatically logs the function’s **name, inputs, outputs, and execution time**.
- Can be used alongside **auto-tracing** features, such as `mlflow.openai.autolog`.

### Example

The following code is a minimum example of using the decorator for tracing Python functions.

```python
import mlflow


@mlflow.trace(span_type="func", attributes={"key": "value"})
def add_1(x):
    return x + 1


@mlflow.trace(span_type="func", attributes={"key1": "value1"})
def minus_1(x):
    return x - 1


@mlflow.trace(name="Trace Test")
def trace_test(x):
    step1 = add_1(x)
    return minus_1(step1)


trace_test(4)
```

:::note
When a trace contains multiple spans with same name, MLflow appends an auto-incrementing suffix to them, such as `_1`, `_2`.
:::

### Customizing Spans

The <APILink fn="mlflow.trace">`@mlflow.trace`</APILink> decorator accepts following arguments to customize the span to be created:

- `name` parameter to override the span name from the default (the name of decorated function)
- `span_type` parameter to set the type of span. Set either one of built-in [Span Types](/tracing/tracing-schema#span-types) or a string.
- `attributes` parameter to add custom attributes to the span.

```python
@mlflow.trace(
    name="call-local-llm", span_type=SpanType.LLM, attributes={"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
)
def invoke(prompt: str):
    return client.invoke(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], model="gpt-4o-mini"
    )
```

Alternatively, you can update the span dynamically inside the function by using <APILink fn="mlflow.get_current_active_span">`mlflow.get_current_active_span`</APILink> API.

```python
@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.LLM)
def invoke(prompt: str):
    model_id = "gpt-4o-mini"
    # Get the current span (created by the @mlflow.trace decorator)
    span = mlflow.get_current_active_span()
    # Set the attribute to the span
    span.set_attributes({"model": model_id})
    return client.invoke(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], model=model_id)
```

### Adding Trace Tags

Tags can be added to traces to provide additional metadata at the trace level. There are a few different ways to set tags on a trace. Please refer to the [how-to guide](/tracing/api/how-to/#setting-trace-tags) for the other methods.

```python
@mlflow.trace
def my_func(x):
    mlflow.update_current_trace(tags={"fruit": "apple"})
    return x + 1
```

### Automatic Exception Handling

If an `Exception` is raised during processing of a trace-instrumented operation, an indication will be shown within the UI that the invocation was not
successful and a partial capture of data will be available to aid in debugging. Additionally, details about the Exception that was raised will be included
within `Events` of the partially completed span, further aiding the identification of where issues are occurring within your code.

### Combining with Auto-Tracing

The `@mlflow.trace` decorator can be used in conjunction with auto tracing. For example, the following code combines OpenAI auto-tracing with manually defined spans in a single cohesive and integrated trace.

```python
import mlflow
import openai

mlflow.openai.autolog()


@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.CHAIN)
def run(question):
    messages = build_messages()
    # MLflow automatically generates a span for OpenAI invocation
    response = openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_tokens=100,
        messages=messages,
    )
    return parse_response(response)


@mlflow.trace
def build_messages(question):
    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful chatbot."},
        {"role": "user", "content": question},
    ]


@mlflow.trace
def parse_response(response):
    return response.choices[0].message.content


run("What is MLflow?")
```

Running this code generates the following single trace:

### Function Wrapping

Function wrapping provides a flexible way to add tracing to existing functions without modifying their definitions. This is particularly useful when you want to add tracing to third-party functions or functions defined outside of your control. By wrapping an external function with <APILink fn="mlflow.trace">`@mlflow.trace`</APILink>, you can capture its inputs, outputs, and execution context.

```python
import math
import mlflow


def invocation(x, y, exp=2):
    # Wrap an external function from the math library
    traced_pow = mlflow.trace(math.pow)
    raised = traced_pow(x, exp)

    traced_factorial = mlflow.trace(math.factorial)
    factorial = traced_factorial(int(raised))
    return response


invocation(4)
```

## Context Manager

In addition to the decorator, MLflow allows for creating a span that can then be accessed within any encapsulated arbitrary code block using the <APILink fn="mlflow.start_span" /> context manager. It can be useful for capturing complex interactions within your code in finer detail than what is possible by capturing the boundaries of a single function.

Similarly to the decorator, the context manager automatically captures parent-child relationship, exceptions, execution time, and works with auto-tracing. However, the name, inputs, and outputs of the span must be provided manually. You can set them via the <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">Span</APILink> object that is returned from the context manager.

```python
with mlflow.start_span(name="my_span") as span:
    span.set_inputs({"x": 1, "y": 2})
    z = x + y
    span.set_outputs(z)
```

Below is a slightly more complex example that uses the <APILink fn="mlflow.start_span" /> context manager in conjunction with both the decorator and auto-tracing for OpenAI.

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import SpanType


@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.CHAIN)
def start_session():
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly chat bot"}]
    while True:
        with mlflow.start_span(name="User") as span:
            span.set_inputs(messages)
            user_input = input(">> ")
            span.set_outputs(user_input)

        if user_input == "BYE":
            break

        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

        response = openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            max_tokens=100,
            messages=messages,
        )
        answer = response.choices[0].message.content
        print(f"🤖: {answer}")

        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": answer})


mlflow.openai.autolog()
start_session()
```

## (Advanced) Low-level Client APIs

When the decorator or context manager does not meet your requirements, you can use the low-level client APIs. For example, you might need to start and end a span from different functions. The client API is designed as a thin wrapper over the MLflow REST APIs, giving you more control over the trace lifecycle. For more details, please refer to the [MLflow Tracing Client APIs](/tracing/api/client) guide.

:::warning
When using client APIs, please be aware of the following limitations:

- The parent-child relationship is NOT captured automatically. You need to manually pass the ID of the parent span.
- Spans created using the client API do NOT combine with auto-tracing spans.
- Low-level APIs marked as experimental are subject to change based on backend implementation updates.
