# Tracing OpenAI Swarm🐝

:::warning

    OpenAI Swarm integration has been deprecated because the library is being replaced by the
    new [OpenAI Agents SDK](./openai-agent). Please consider migrating to the new SDK for the latest features and support.

![OpenAI Tracing via autolog](/images/llms/tracing/openai-swarm-tracing.png)


[MLflow Tracing](../) provides automatic tracing capability for [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm), a multi-agent framework developed by OpenAI. By enabling auto tracing
for OpenAI by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.openai.autolog" /> function, MLflow will capture nested traces and log them to the active MLflow Experiment upon invocation of OpenAI SDK.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.openai.autolog()
```

In addition to the basic LLM call tracing for OpenAI, MLflow captures the intermediate steps that the Swarm agent operates and all tool-calling by the agent.

:::tip

MLflow OpenAI integration is not only about tracing. MLflow offers full tracking experience for OpenAI, including model tracking, prompt management, and evaluation. Please checkout the **[MLflow OpenAI Flavor](/llms/openai)** to learn more!

### Basic Example

```python
import mlflow
from swarm import Swarm, Agent

# Calling the autolog API will enable trace logging by default.
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("OpenAI Swarm")

# Define a simple multi-agent workflow using OpenAI Swarm
client = Swarm()


def transfer_to_agent_b():
    return agent_b


agent_a = Agent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    functions=[transfer_to_agent_b],
)

agent_b = Agent(
    name="Agent B",
    instructions="Only speak in Haikus.",
)

response = client.run(
    agent=agent_a,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I want to talk to agent B."}],
)
```

### Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for OpenAI Swarm can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.openai.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
