# Tracing Groq

![Groq tracing via autolog](/images/llms/groq/groq-tracing.png)

MLflow Tracing provides automatic tracing capability when using Groq.
When Groq auto-tracing is enabled by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.groq.autolog" /> function,
usage of the Groq SDK will automatically record generated traces during interactive development.

Note that only synchronous calls are supported, and that asynchronous API and streaming methods are not traced.

### Example Usage

```python
import groq

import mlflow

# Turn on auto tracing for Groq by calling mlflow.groq.autolog()
mlflow.groq.autolog()

client = groq.Groq()

# Use the create method to create new message
message = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama3-8b-8192",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.",
        }
    ],
)

print(message.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for Groq can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.groq.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
