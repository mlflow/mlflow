# Tracing LangGraphü¶úüï∏Ô∏è

![LangChain Tracing via autolog](/images/llms/tracing/langgraph-tracing.gif)

[LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) is an open-source library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows.

[MLflow Tracing](../) provides automatic tracing capability for LangGraph, as a extension of its LangChain integration. By enabling auto-tracing for LangChain by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.langchain.autolog" /> function, MLflow will
automatically capture the graph execution into a trace and log it to the active MLflow Experiment.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.langchain.autolog()
```

:::tip

MLflow LangGraph integration is not only about tracing. MLflow offers full tracking experience for LangGraph, including model tracking, dependency management, and evaluation. Please checkout the **[MLflow LangChain Flavor](/llms/langchain)** to learn more!

### Usage

Running the following code will generate a trace for the graph as shown in the above video clip.

```python
from typing import Literal

import mlflow

from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, ToolCall
from langchain_core.outputs import ChatGeneration, ChatResult
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

# Enabling tracing for LangGraph (LangChain)
mlflow.langchain.autolog()

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("LangGraph")


@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"


llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
tools = [get_weather]
graph = create_react_agent(llm, tools)

# Invoke the graph
result = graph.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf?"}]}
)
```

### Adding spans within a node or a tool

By combining auto-tracing with the [manual tracing APIs](../sdk/manual-instrumentation), you can add child spans inside a node or tool, to get more detailed insights for the step.

Let's take LangGraph's [Code Assistant](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/code_assistant/langgraph_code_assistant/#graph) tutorial for example. The `check_code` node actually consists of two different validations for the generated code. You may want to add span for each validation to see which validation were executed. To do so, simply create manual spans inside the node function.

```python
def code_check(state: GraphState):
    # State
    messages = state["messages"]
    code_solution = state["generation"]
    iterations = state["iterations"]

    # Get solution components
    imports = code_solution.imports
    code = code_solution.code

    # Check imports
    try:
        # Create a child span manually with mlflow.start_span() API
        with mlflow.start_span(name="import_check", span_type=SpanType.TOOL) as span:
            span.set_inputs(imports)
            exec(imports)
            span.set_outputs("ok")
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = [("user", f"Your solution failed the import test: {e}")]
        messages += error_message
        return {
            "generation": code_solution,
            "messages": messages,
            "iterations": iterations,
            "error": "yes",
        }

    # Check execution
    try:
        code = imports + "\n" + code
        with mlflow.start_span(name="execution_check", span_type=SpanType.TOOL) as span:
            span.set_inputs(code)
            exec(code)
            span.set_outputs("ok")
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = [("user", f"Your solution failed the code execution test: {e}")]
        messages += error_message
        return {
            "generation": code_solution,
            "messages": messages,
            "iterations": iterations,
            "error": "yes",
        }

    # No errors
    return {
        "generation": code_solution,
        "messages": messages,
        "iterations": iterations,
        "error": "no",
    }
```

This way, the span for the `check_code` node will have child spans, which record whether the each validation fails or not, with their exception details.

### Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for LangGraph can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.langchain.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
