# Tracing Gemini

![OpenAI Tracing via autolog](/images/llms/gemini/gemini-tracing.png)


[MLflow Tracing](../) provides automatic tracing capability for Google Gemini. By enabling auto tracing
for Gemini by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.gemini.autolog" /> function, MLflow will capture nested traces and log them to the active MLflow Experiment upon invocation of Gemini Python SDK.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.gemini.autolog()
```

:::note

Current MLflow tracing integration supports both new [Google GenAI SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai) and legacy [Google AI Python SDK](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-python). 
However, it may drop support for the legacy package without notice, and it is highly recommended to migrate your use cases to the new Google GenAI SDK.

:::

MLflow trace automatically captures the following information about Gemini calls:

* Prompts and completion responses
* Latencies
* Model name
* Additional metadata such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, if specified.
* Function calling if returned in the response
* Any exception if raised

:::note

Currently, MLflow Gemini integration only supports tracing of synchronous calls for text interactions. Async APIs are not traced and full inputs may not be recorded for multi-modal inputs.

### Basic Example


```python
import mlflow
import google.genai as genai
import os

# Turn on auto tracing for Gemini
mlflow.gemini.autolog()

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("Gemini")


# Configure the SDK with your API key.
client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"])

# Use the generate_content method to generate responses to your prompts.
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-1.5-flash", contents="The opposite of hot is"
)
```

### Multi-turn chat interactions

MLflow support tracing multi-turn conversations with Gemini:

```
import mlflow

mlflow.gemini.autolog()

chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-1.5-flash')
response = chat.send_message("In one sentence, explain how a computer works to a young child.")
print(response.text)
response = chat.send_message("Okay, how about a more detailed explanation to a high schooler?")
print(response.text)
```

### Embeddings

MLflow Tracing for Gemini SDK supports embeddings API:

```python
result = client.models.embed_content(model="text-embedding-004", contents="Hello world")
```

### Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for Gemini can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.gemini.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
