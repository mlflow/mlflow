# Tracing LlamaIndexðŸ¦™

![LlamaIndex Tracing via autolog](/images/llms/tracing/llamaindex-tracing.gif)

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is an open-source framework for building agentic generative AI applications that allow large language models to work with your data in any format.

[MLflow Tracing](../) provides automatic tracing capability for LlamaIndex. You can enable tracing
for LlamaIndex by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.llama_index.autolog" /> function, and nested traces are automatically logged to the active MLflow Experiment upon invocation of LlamaIndex engines and workflows.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.llama_index.autolog()
```

:::tip

MLflow LlamaIndex integration is not only about tracing. MLflow offers full tracking experience for LlamaIndex, including model tracking, index management, and evaluation. Please checkout the **[MLflow LlamaIndex Flavor](/llms/llama-index)** to learn more!

### Example Usage

First, let's download a test data to create a toy index:

```
!mkdir -p data
!curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt -o ./data/paul_graham_essay.txt
```

Load them into a simple in-memory vector index:

```
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
```

Now you can enable LlamaIndex auto tracing and start querying the index:

```python
import mlflow

# Enabling tracing for LlamaIndex
mlflow.llama_index.autolog()

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("LlamaIndex")

# Query the index
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What was the first program the author wrote?")
```


### LlamaIndex workflow

The `Workflow` is LlamaIndexâ€™s next-generation GenAI orchestration framework. It is designed as a flexible and interpretable framework for building arbitrary LLM applications such as an agent, a RAG flow, a data extraction pipeline, etc. MLflow supports tracking, evaluating, and tracing the Workflow objects, which makes them more observable and maintainable.

Automatic tracing for LlamaIndex workflow works off-the-shelf by calling the same `mlflow.llama_index.autolog()`.

To learn more about MLflow's integration with LlamaIndex Workflow, continue to the following tutorials:

* [Building a Tool-calling Agent with LlamaIndex Workflow and MLflow](/llms/llama-index/notebooks/llama_index_workflow_tutorial)
* [Building Advanced RAG with MLflow and LlamaIndex Workflow](https://mlflow.org/blog/mlflow-llama-index-workflow)


### Disable auto-tracing

Auto tracing for LlamaIndex can be disabled globally by calling `mlflow.llama_index.autolog(disable=True)` or `mlflow.autolog(disable=True)`.
