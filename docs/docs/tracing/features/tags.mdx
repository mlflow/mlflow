## Setting Trace Tags

Tags can be added to traces to provide additional metadata at the trace level. For example, you can attach a session ID to a trace to group traces by a conversation session. MLflow provides APIs to set and delete tags on traces. Select the right API based on whether you want to set tags on an active trace or on an already finished trace.

### Setting Tags on an Active Trace

If you are using automatic tracing or fluent APIs to create traces and want to add tags to the trace during its execution, you can use the <APILink fn="mlflow.update_current_trace" /> function.

For example, the following code example adds the `"fruit": "apple"` tag to the trace created for the `my_func` function:

```python
@mlflow.trace
def my_func(x):
    mlflow.update_current_trace(tags={"fruit": "apple"})
    return x + 1
```

:::note

The <APILink fn="mlflow.update_current_trace" /> function adds the specified tag(s) to the current trace when the key is not already present. If the key is already present, it updates the key with the new value.

### Setting Tags on a Finished Trace

To set tags on a trace that has already been completed and logged in the backend store, use the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.set_trace_tag">`MlflowClient.set_trace_tag`</APILink> method to set a tag on a trace,
and the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.delete_trace_tag">`MlflowClient.delete_trace_tag`</APILink> method to remove a tag from a trace.

```python
# Set a tag on a trace
client.set_trace_tag(request_id=request_id, key="tag_key", value="tag_value")

# Delete a tag from a trace
client.delete_trace_tag(request_id=request_id, key="tag_key")
```

### Setting Tags via the MLflow UI

Alternatively, you can update or delete tags on a trace from the MLflow UI. To do this, navigate to the trace tab, then click on the pencil icon next to the tag you want to update.
