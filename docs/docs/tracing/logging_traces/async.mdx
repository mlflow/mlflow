# Logging traces asynchronously

## <span style={{color: "red"}}>TODO: do we really need this?  shouldn't it be automatic?  can we push to api docs?</span>


By default, MLflow Traces are logged synchronously. This may introduce a performance overhead when logging Traces, especially when your MLflow Tracking Server is running on a remote server. If the performance overhead is a concern for you, you can enable **asynchronous logging** for tracing in MLflow 2.16.0 and later.

To enable async logging for tracing, call <APILink fn="mlflow.config.enable_async_logging" /> in your code. This will make the trace logging operation non-blocking and reduce the performance overhead.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.config.enable_async_logging()

# Traces will be logged asynchronously
with mlflow.start_span(name="foo") as span:
    span.set_inputs({"a": 1})
    span.set_outputs({"b": 2})

# If you don't see the traces in the UI after waiting for a while, you can manually flush the traces
# mlflow.flush_trace_async_logging()
```

Note that the async logging does not fully eliminate the performance overhead. Some backend calls still need to be made synchronously and there are other factors such as data serialization. However, async logging can significantly reduce the overall overhead of logging traces, empirically about ~80% for typical workloads.
