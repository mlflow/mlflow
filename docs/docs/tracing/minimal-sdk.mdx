# Lightweight Tracing SDK Optimized for Production Usage

MLflow offers a lightweight tracing SDK package called `mlflow-tracing` that includes only the essential functionality for tracing and monitoring of your GenAI applications. This package is designed for production environments where minimizing dependencies and deployment size is ideal.

## Why Use the Lightweight SDK?


<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <TitleCard
        title="🏎️ Faster Deployment"
        description="The package size and dependencies are significantly smaller than the full MLflow package, allowing for faster deployment times in dynamic environments such as Docker containers, serverless functions, and cloud-based applications."
    />
    <TitleCard
        title="🔧 Simplified Dependency Management"
        description="A smaller set of dependencies means less work keeping up with dependency updates, security patches, and potential breaking changes from upstream libraries.  It also reduces the chances of dependency collisions and incompatibilities."
    />
    <TitleCard
        title="📦 Portability"
        description="With a fewer number of dependencies, MLflow Tracing can be seamlessly deployed across differing environments and platforms, without worrying about compatibility issues."
    />
    <TitleCard
        title="🔒 Fewer Security Risks"
        description="Each dependency potentially introduces security vulnerabilities. By reducing the number of dependencies, MLflow Tracing minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of security breaches."
    />
</CardGroup>

## Installation

Install the lightweight SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install mlflow-tracing
```

:::warning

Do not install the full `mlflow` package together with the lightweight `mlflow-tracing` SDK, as this may cause version conflicts and namespace resolution issues.

:::

## Quickstart

Here's a simple example using the lightweight SDK with OpenAI for logging traces to an experiment
on a remote MLflow server. If you haven't set up a remote MLflow server yet, please refer to the [Choose Your Backend](#choose-your-backend) section below.


```python
import mlflow
import openai

# Set the tracking URI (e.g., Databricks, SageMaker, or self-hosted server)
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("<your-tracking-uri>")
mlflow.set_experiment("<your-experiment-name>")

# Enable auto-tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Use OpenAI as usual
client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is MLflow?"}]
)
```


## Choose Your Backend

The lightweight SDK works with various observability platforms. Choose your favorite one and follow the instructions to set up your tracing backend.

          [Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring for GenAI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/monitoring) is a go-to solution for monitoring your
          GenAI application with MLflow Tracing. It provides an access to a robust, fully functional monitoring dashboard for operational excellence and quality analysis.

          Lakehouse Monitoring for GenAI can be used regardless of whether your application is hosted on Databricks or not.

          MLflow is a **fully open-source project**, allowing you to self-host your own MLflow server in your own infrastructure. This is a great option if you want to have full control over your data and are restricted in using cloud-based services.

          In self-hosting mode, you will be responsible for running the tracking server instance
          and scaling it to your needs. We **strongly recommend** using a SQL-based tracking server
          on top of the performant database of your choice to minimize the operational overhead
          and high availability. Please refer to the [tracking server setup guide](/tracking#tracking-setup) for more guidance.

          MLflow Tracing is **built on the OpenTelemetry tracing spec**, an industry-standard framework for observability, making it vendor-neutral solution for monitoring your GenAI applications.

          If you are using OpenTelemetry as a part of observability tech stack in your
          team or organization, you can use MLflow Tracing without any additional
          service onboarding. Please refer to the [OpenTelemetry Integration](/tracing/production#opentelemetry-integration) to connect MLflow Tracing to your
          OpenTelemetry backend.
