# Trace Data Structure

This document provides a detailed view of the schema for traces and its ingredients. MLflow traces are **compatible to OpenTelemetry specs**,
but we also define a few additional layers of structure upon the OpenTelemetry Spans to provide additional metadata about the trace.

## Structure of Traces

**TL;DR**: `Trace = TraceInfo + TraceData` where `TraceData = List[Span]`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="trace" label="Trace" default>
    #### Trace Structure
    
    A <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Trace">`Trace`</APILink> in MLflow consists of two components: 
    <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">`Trace Info`</APILink> and 
    <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceData">`Trace Data`</APILink>.
        
    The metadata that aids in explaining the origination
    of the trace, the status of the trace, and the information about the total execution time is stored within the Trace Info. The Trace
    Data is comprised entirely of the instrumented <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">`Span`</APILink>
    objects that make up the core of the trace.

    </div>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="trace-info" label="Trace Info">
    #### Trace Info Structure

    The Trace Info within MLflow's tracing feature aims to provide a lightweight snapshot of critical data about the overall trace.
    This includes the logistical information about the trace, such as the experiment_id, providing the storage location for the trace,
    as well as trace-level data such as start time and total execution time. The Trace Info also includes tags and status information for
    the trace as a whole.

    <div class="max-height-img-container" style={{ maxHeight: "400px" }}>

    </div>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="trace-data" label="Trace Data">
    #### Trace Data Structure

    The Trace Data within MLflow's tracing feature provides the core of the trace information. Within this object is a list of
    <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">`Span`</APILink> objects that represent the individual steps of the trace.
    These spans are associated with one another in a hierarchical relationship, providing a clear order-of-operations linkage of what
    happened within your application during the trace.

    <div class="max-height-img-container" style={{ maxHeight: "400px" }}>

    </div>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="span" label="Span">
    #### Span Structure

    The Span object within MLflow's tracing feature provides detailed information about the individual steps of the trace.
    It complies to the [OpenTelemetry Span spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces#spans).
    Each Span object contains information about the step being instrumented, including the span_id, name, start_time, parent_id, status,
    inputs, outputs, attributes, and events.

## Trace

A trace is a root object composed of two components:

- <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">`TraceInfo`</APILink>
- <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceData">`TraceData`</APILink>

:::tip
Check the API documentation for helper methods on these dataclass objects for more information on how to convert or extract data from them.
:::

## Trace Info

Trace Info is a dataclass object that contains metadata about the trace. This metadata includes information about the trace's origin, status, and
various other data that aids in retrieving and filtering traces when used with <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_traces" /> and for
navigation of traces within the MLflow UI.

To learn more about how `TraceInfo` metadata is used for searching, you can see examples [here](/tracing/api/search).

The data that is contained in the `TraceInfo` object is used to populate the trace view page within the MLflow tracking UI, as shown below.

![TraceInfo as it is used in the MLflow UI](/images/llms/tracing/schema/trace_info_in_ui.png)

The primary components of MLflow <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.TraceInfo">`TraceInfo`</APILink> objects are listed below.

    <tr>
      <td>**request_id**</td>
      <td>
        A unique identifier for the trace. The identifier is used within MLflow
        and integrated system to resolve the event being captured and to provide

        originating caller.

      <td>
        The time reflected in this property is the time at with the trace was
        created, not the time at which a request to your application was made.
        As such, it does not factor into account the time it took to process the
        request to the environment in which your application is being served,
        which may introduce additional latency to the total round trip time,
        depending on network configurations.

        while an application was being instrumented. The error can be seen
        within the span data for the trace.

        started and is currently running. Temporary state that will update while
        spans are being logged to a trace.

## Trace Data

The MLflow <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.trace_data.TraceData">`TraceData`</APILink> object is a dataclass object that holds the core of the trace data.
This object contains the following elements:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>**Property**</th>
      <th>**Description**</th>
      <th>**Note**</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**request**</td>
      <td>The `request` property is the input data for the entire trace. The input `str` is a JSON-serialized string that contains the input data for the trace, typically the end-user request that was submitted as a call to the application.</td>
      <td>Due to the varied structures of inputs that could go to a given application that is being instrumented by MLflow Tracing, all inputs are JSON serialized for compatibility’s sake. This allows for the input data to be stored in a consistent format, regardless of the input data’s structure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**spans**</td>
      <td>
        {"This property is a list of "}
        <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span">{"Span"}</APILink>
        {" objects that represent the individual steps of the trace."}
      </td>
      <td>For further information on the structure of Span objects, see the section below.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**response**</td>
      <td>The response property is the final output data that will be returned to the caller of the invocation of the application.</td>
      <td>Similar to the request property, this value is a JSON-serialized string to maximize compatibility of disparate formats.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Span Schema

Spans are the core of the trace data. They record key, critical data about each of the steps within your genai application.

When you view your traces within the MLflow UI, you're looking at a collection of spans, as shown below.

![Spans within the MLflow UI](/images/llms/tracing/schema/spans_in_mlflow_ui.png)

The sections below provide a detailed view of the structure of a span.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>**Property**</th>
      <th>**Description**</th>
      <th>**Note**</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**inputs**</td>
      <td>
          The inputs are stored as JSON-serialized strings, representing the
          input data that is passed into the particular stage (step) of your
          application. Due to the wide variety of input data that can be passed
          between specific stages of a GenAI application, this data may be
          extremely large (such as when using the output of a vector store
          retrieval step).
      </td>
      <td>
        Reviewing the Inputs, along with the Outputs, of individual stages can
        dramatically increase the ability to diagnose and debug issues that
        exist with responses coming from your application.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**outputs**</td>
      <td>
        The outputs are stored as JSON-serialized strings, representing the
        output data that is passed out of the particular stage (step) of your
        application.
      </td>
      <td>
        Just as with the Inputs, the Outputs can be quite large, depending on
        the complexity of the data that is being passed between stages.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**attributes**</td>
      <td>
        Attributes are metadata that are associated with a given step within
        your application. These attributes are key-value pairs that can be used
        to provide insight into behavioral modifications for function and method
        calls, giving insight into how modification of them can affect the
        performance of your application.
      </td>
      <td>
          Common examples of attributes that could be associated with a given
          span include:

          - **model**
          - **temperature**
          - **document_count**

          These attributes provide additional context and insight into the results that are present in the outputs property for the span.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**events**</td>
      <td>
        Events are a system-level property that is optionally applied to a span
        only if there was an issue during the execution of the span. These
        events contain information about exceptions that were thrown in the
        instrumented call, as well as the stack trace.
      </td>
      <td>
          {"This data is structured within a "}
          <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.SpanEvent">{"SpanEvent"}</APILink>
        {" object, containing the properties:"}
        - **name**
        - **timestamp**
        - **attributes**

        **The attributes** property contains the stack trace of the exception that was thrown during the execution of the span if such an error occurred during execution.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**parent_id**</td>
      <td>
        The `parent_id` property is an identifier that establishes the
        hierarchical association of a given span with its parent span. This is
        used to establish an event chain for the spans, helping to determine
        which step followed another step in the execution of the application.
      </td>
      <td>
        A span **must** have a `parent_id` set.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**span_id**</td>
      <td>
        The `span_id` is a unique identifier that is generated for each span
        within a trace. This identifier is used to disambiguate spans from one
        another and allow for proper association of the span within the
        sequential execution of other spans within a trace.
      </td>
      <td>A `span_id` is set when a span is created and is immutable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**request_id**</td>
      <td>
        The `request_id` property is a unique identifier that is generated for
        each **trace** and is propagated to each span that is a member of that trace.
      </td>
      <td>The `request_id` is a system-generated property and is immutable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**name**</td>
      <td>
        The name of the trace is either user-defined (optionally when using the
        fluent and client APIs) or is automatically generated through CallBack
        integrations or when omitting the name argument when calling the fluent
        or client APIs. If the name is not overridden, the name will be
        generated based on the name of the function or method that is being
        instrumented.
      </td>
      <td>
        It is recommended to provide a name for your span that is unique and
        relevant to the functionality that is being executed when using manual
        instumentation via the client or fluent APIs. Generic names for spans or
        confusing names can make it difficult to diagnose issues when reviewing
        traces.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**status**</td>
      <td>
        The status of a span is reflected in a value from the enumeration object
        `SpanStatusCode`. The span status object contains an optional description
        if the `status_code` is reflecting an error that occurred. The values that
        the status may have are:
        - **OK** - The span and the underlying instrumented
        call were successful.
        - **UNSET** - The status of the span hasn’t been set yet
        (this is the default value and should not be seen in logged trace
        events)
        - **ERROR** - An issue happened within the call being instrumented.
        The `description` property will contain additional information about the
        error that occurred.
      </td>
      <td>
        Evaluating the status of spans can greatly reduce the amount of time and
        effort required to diagnose issues with your applications.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**start_time_ns**</td>
      <td>The unix timestamp (in nanoseconds) when the span was started.</td>
      <td>
        The precision of this property is higher than that of the trace start
        time, allowing for more granular analysis of the execution time of very
        short-lived spans.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**end_time_ns**</td>
      <td>The unix timestamp (in nanoseconds) when the span was ended.</td>
      <td>
        This precision is higher than the trace timestamps, similar to the
        `start_time_ns` timestamp above.
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

## Span Types

Span types are a way to categorize spans within a trace. By default, the span type is set to `"UNKNOWN"` when using the trace decorator. MLflow provides a set of predefined span types for common use cases, while also allowing you to setting custom span types.

The following span types are available:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>**Span Type**</th>
      <th>**Description**</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`"LLM"`</td>
      <td>Represents a call to an LLM endpoint or a local model.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"CHAT_MODEL"`</td>
      <td>Represents a query to a chat model. This is a special case of an LLM interaction.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"CHAIN"`</td>
      <td>Represents a chain of operations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"AGENT"`</td>
      <td>Represents an autonomous agent operation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"TOOL"`</td>
      <td>Represents a tool execution (typically by an agent), such as querying a search engine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"EMBEDDING"`</td>
      <td>Represents a text embedding operation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"RETRIEVER"`</td>
      <td>Represents a context retrieval operation, such as querying a vector database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"PARSER"`</td>
      <td>Represents a parsing operation, transforming text into a structured format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"RERANKER"`</td>
      <td>Represents a re-ranking operation, ordering the retrieved contexts based on relevance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`"UNKNOWN"`</td>
      <td>A default span type that is used when no other span type is specified.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To set a span type, you can pass the `span_type` parameter to the <APILink fn="mlflow.trace">`@mlflow.trace`</APILink> decorator or <APILink fn="mlflow.start_span" />
context manager. When you are using [automatic tracing](/tracing/#automatic-tracing), the span type is automatically set by MLflow.

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import SpanType


# Using a built-in span type
@mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.RETRIEVER)
def retrieve_documents(query: str):
    ...


# Setting a custom span type
with mlflow.start_span(name="add", span_type="MATH") as span:
    span.set_inputs({"x": z, "y": y})
    z = x + y
    span.set_outputs({"z": z})

    print(span.span_type)
    # Output: MATH
```

## Schema for specific span types

MLflow has a set of 10 predefined types of spans (see <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.SpanType">mlflow.entities.SpanType</APILink>), and
certain span types have properties that are required in order to enable additional functionality
within the UI and downstream tasks such as evaluation.

### Retriever Spans

The `RETRIEVER` span type is used for operations involving retrieving data from a data store (for example, querying
documents from a vector store). The `RETRIEVER` span type has the following schema:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>**Property**</th>
      <th>**Description**</th>
      <th>**Note**</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Input**</td>
      <td>There are no restrictions on the span inputs</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Output**</td>
      <td>
        {"The output must be of type "}
        <code>
          {"List["}
          <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Document">
            {"mlflow.entities.Document"}
          </APILink>
          {"]"}
        </code>
        {
          ", or a dict matching the structure of the dataclass*. The dataclass contains the following properties:"
        }

        - **id** (`Optional[str]`) - An optional unique identifier for the document.
        - **page_content** (`str`) - The text content of the document.
        - **metadata** (`Optional[Dict[str,any]]`) - The metadata associated with the document. There are two important metadata keys that are reserved for the MLflow UI and evaluation metrics:
          - `"doc_uri" (str)`: The URI for the document. This is used for rendering a link in the UI.
          - `"chunk_id" (str)`: If your document is broken up into chunks in your data store, this key can be used to
            identify the chunk that the document is a part of. This is used by some evaluation metrics.
      </td>
      <td>
        This output structure is guaranteed to be provided if the traces are generated via MLflow autologging for the LangChain and LlamaIndex flavors.
        By conforming to this specification, `RETRIEVER` spans will be rendered in a more user-friendly manner in the MLflow UI, and downstream tasks
        such as evaluation will function as expected.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Attributes**</td>
      <td>There are no restrictions on the span attributes</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

\* For example, both `[Document(page_content="Hello world", metadata={"doc_uri": "https://example.com"})]` and
`[{"page_content": "Hello world", "metadata": {"doc_uri": "https://example.com"}}]` are valid outputs for a `RETRIEVER` span.

### Chat Completion Spans

Spans of type `CHAT_MODEL` or `LLM` are used to represent interactions with a chat completions API
(for example, OpenAI's [chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create),
or Anthropic's [messages](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages) API). As providers can have
different schemas for their API, there are no restrictions on the format of the span's inputs and
outputs.

However, it is still important to have a common schema in order to enable certain UI features (e.g. rich
conversation display), and to make authoring evaluation functions easier. To support this, we specify some
custom attributes for standardized chat messages and tool definitions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>**Attribute Name**</th>
      <th>**Description**</th>
      <th>**Note**</th>
    </tr>

        This attribute represents the system/user/assistant messages involved in the
        conversation with the chat model. It enables rich conversation rendering in the UI,
        and will also be used in MLflow evaluation in the future.

      <td>
        This attribute can be conveniently set using the <APILink fn="mlflow.tracing.set_span_chat_messages" /> function. This function
        will throw a validation error if the data does not conform to the spec.

        This attribute represents the tools that were available for the chat model to call. In the OpenAI
        context, this would be equivalent to the [tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-tools>) 
        param in the Chat Completions API.

Please refer to the example below for a quick demonstration of how to use the utility functions described above, as well as
how to retrieve them using the <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Span.get_attribute">span.get_attribute()</APILink> function:

```python

from mlflow.entities.span import SpanType
from mlflow.tracing.constant import SpanAttributeKey
from mlflow.tracing import set_span_chat_messages, set_span_chat_tools

# example messages and tools

        "content": "please use the provided tool to answer the user's questions",
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "what is 1 + 1?"},
]

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
