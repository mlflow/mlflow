# FAQ

### Q: I cannot open my trace in the MLflow UI. What should I do?

There are multiple possible reasons why a trace may not be viewable in the MLflow UI.

1. **The trace is not completed yet**: If the trace is still being collected, MLflow cannot display spans in the UI. Ensure that all spans are properly ended with either "OK" or "ERROR" status.

2. **The browser cache is outdated**: When you upgrade MLflow to a new version, the browser cache may contain outdated data and prevent the UI from displaying traces correctly. Clear your browser cache (Shift+F5) and refresh the page.

### Q: The model execution gets stuck and my trace is "in progress" forever.

Sometimes a model or an agent gets stuck in a long-running operation or an infinite loop, causing the trace to be stuck in the "in progress" state.

To prevent this, you can set a timeout for the trace using the `MLFLOW_TRACE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable. If the trace exceeds the timeout, MLflow will automatically halt the trace with `ERROR` status and export it to the backend, so that you can analyze the spans to identify the issue. By default, the timeout is not set.

:::note
The timeout only applies to MLflow trace. The main program, model, or agent, will continue to run even if the trace is halted.
:::

For example, the following code sets the timeout to 5 seconds and simulates how MLflow handles a long-running operation:

```python
import mlflow
import os
import time

# Set the timeout to 5 seconds for demonstration purposes
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS"] = "5"


# Simulate a long-running operation
@mlflow.trace
def long_running():
    for _ in range(10):
        child()


@mlflow.trace
def child():
    time.sleep(1)


long_running()
```

:::note
MLflow monitors the trace execution time and expiration in a background thread. By default, this check is performed every second and  resource consumption is negligible. If you want to adjust the interval, you can set the `MLFLOW_TRACE_TIMEOUT_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` environment variable.
