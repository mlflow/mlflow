# MLflow Tracing UI

The MLflow Trace UI 


## Jupyter Notebook integration

:::note
The MLflow Tracing Jupyter integration is available in **MLflow 2.20 and above**
:::

The trace UI is also available within Jupyter notebooks! 

![Jupyter Trace UI](/images/llms/tracing/jupyter-trace-ui.png)

This feature requires using an [MLflow Tracking Server](/tracking/server/), as
this is where the UI assets are fetched from. To get started, simply ensure that the MLflow
Tracking URI is set to your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")`).

By default, the trace UI will automatically be displayed for the following events:

1. When the cell code generates a trace (e.g. via  [automatic tracing](/tracing/#automatic-tracing), or by running a manually traced function)
2. When <APILink fn="mlflow.search_traces" /> is called
3. When a <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.Trace" /> object is displayed (e.g. via IPython's `display` function, or when it is the last value returned in a cell)

To disable the display, simply call <APILink fn="mlflow.tracing.disable_notebook_display" />, and rerun the cell
containing the UI. To enable it again, call <APILink fn="mlflow.tracing.enable_notebook_display" />.

For a more complete example, try running this [demo notebook](/tracing/tutorials/jupyter-trace-demo/)!
