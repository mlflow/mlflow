    "### Time Series Visualization of Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we're creating a time series plot to visualize the demand data alongside its rolling average. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this Important?\n",
    "Visualizing time series data is crucial for identifying patterns, understanding variability, and making more informed decisions. By plotting the rolling average alongside, we can smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. This visual aid is essential for understanding the data and making more accurate and informed predictions and decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure of the Code:\n",
    "- **Input Verification**: The code first ensures the data is a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- **Date Conversion**: It converts the 'date' column to a datetime format for accurate plotting.\n",
    "- **Rolling Average Calculation**: It calculates the rolling average of the 'demand' with a specified window size (`window_size`), defaulting to 7 days.\n",
    "- **Plotting**: It plots both the original demand data and the calculated rolling average on the same plot for comparison. The original demand data is plotted with low alpha to appear \"ghostly,\" ensuring the rolling average stands out.\n",
    "- **Labels and Legend**: Adequate labels and legends are added for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Return a Figure?\n",
    "We return the figure object (`fig`) instead of rendering it directly so that each iteration of a model training event can consume the figure as a logged artifact to MLflow. This approach allows us to persist the state of the data visualization with precisely the state of the data that was used for training. MLflow can store this figure object, enabling easy retrieval and rendering within the MLflow UI, ensuring that the visualization is always accessible and paired with the relevant model and data information.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Structure of the Code:\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot:** The code generates a scatter plot, where each point's position is determined by the `price_per_kg` and `demand`, and the color indicates whether the day is a weekend or a weekday. This color-coding helps in quickly identifying patterns specific to weekends or weekdays.\n",
    "- **Transparency and Jitter:** Points are plotted with transparency (`alpha=0.15`) to handle overplotting, allowing the visualization of the density of points.\n",
    "- **Regression Line:** For each subgroup (weekend and weekday), a separate regression line is fitted and plotted on the same axes. These lines provide a clear visual indication of the trend of demand concerning the price per kg for each group."

    "\n",
    "This section delves deeper into the comprehensive workflow executed for model training, prediction, error calculation, and visualization. The significance of each step and the reason for specific choices are thoroughly discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Benefits of Structured Execution\n",
    "Executing all crucial steps of model training and evaluation in a structured manner is fundamental. It provides a framework that ensures every aspect of the modeling process is considered, offering a more reliable and robust model. This streamlined execution aids in avoiding overlooked errors or biases and guarantees that the model is evaluated on all necessary fronts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Logging Visualizations to MLflow\n",
    "Logging visualizations to MLflow offers several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Permanence**: Unlike the ephemeral state of notebooks where cells can be run out of order leading to potential misinterpretation, logging plots to MLflow ensures that the visualizations are stored permanently with the specific run. This permanence assures that the visual context of the model training and evaluation is preserved, eliminating confusion and ensuring clarity in interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provenance**: By logging visualizations, the exact state and relationships in the data at the time of model training are captured. This practice is crucial for models trained a significant time ago. It offers a reliable reference point to understand the model's behavior and the data characteristics at the time of training, ensuring that insights and interpretations remain valid and reliable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Storing visualizations in MLflow makes them easily accessible to all team members or stakeholders involved. This centralized storage of visualizations enhances collaboration, allowing diverse team members to easily view, analyze, and interpret the visualizations, leading to more informed and collective decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Structure of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up MLflow**: \n",
    "   - The tracking URI for MLflow is defined.\n",
    "   - An experiment named \"Visualizations Demo\" is set up, under which all runs and logs will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**: \n",
    "   - `X` and `y` are defined as features and target variables, respectively.\n",
    "   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initial Plot Generation**: \n",
    "   - Initial plots including time series, box plot, scatter plot, and density plot are generated.\n",
    "   - These plots offer a preliminary insight into the data and its characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Definition and Training**: \n",
    "   - A Ridge regression model is defined with an `alpha` of 1.0.\n",
    "   - The model is trained on the training data, learning the relationships and patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction and Error Calculation**: \n",
    "   - The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "   - Various error metrics including MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, MSLE, and MedAE are calculated to evaluate the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Additional Plot Generation**: \n",
    "   - Additional plots including residuals plot, coefficients plot, prediction error plot, and QQ plot are generated.\n",
    "   - These plots offer further insight into the model’s performance, residuals behavior, and the distribution of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Logging to MLflow**: \n",
    "   - The trained model, calculated metrics, defined parameter (`alpha`), and all the generated plots are logged to MLflow.\n",
    "   - This logging ensures that all information and visualizations related to the model are stored in a centralized, accessible location.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "By executing this comprehensive and structured code, we ensure that every aspect of model training, evaluation, and interpretation is covered. The practice of logging all relevant information and visualizations to MLflow further enhances the reliability, accessibility, and interpretability of the model and its performance, contributing to more informed and reliable model deployment and utilization.\n"
