## Basics of Creating a Custom Python Model with MLflow's Pyfunc

### Introduction

In this initial tutorial, we'll introduce you to the foundational concepts of MLflow's _pyfunc_. We'll illustrate the simplicity and
adaptability of creating, saving, and invoking a custom Python function model within the MLflow ecosystem. By the end, you'll have a
hands-on understanding of a model that adds a specified numeric value to DataFrame columns, highlighting the innate flexibility
of the _pyfunc_ flavor.

### What you will learn

- **Simplicity of Custom PyFunc Models**: Grasp the basic structure of the _PythonModel_ class and how it forms the backbone of custom models in MLflow.
- **Model Persistence**: Understand the straightforward process of saving and retrieving custom models.
- **Invoking Predictions**: Learn the mechanics of how to use a loaded custom _pyfunc_ model for predictions.

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Model Definition**: Begin by crafting a Python class encapsulating the logic for our straightforward "Add N" model.
2. **Persisting the Model**: Use MLflow's capabilities to save the defined model, ensuring it can be retrieved later.
3. **Model Retrieval**: Load the model from its saved location and prepare it for predictions.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use the retrieved model on sample data to witness its functionality.

### Wrap Up

By the conclusion of this tutorial, you'll appreciate the ease and consistency that MLflow's custom _pyfunc_ offers, even for the simplest of models. It sets the stage for more advanced functionalities and use-cases you might explore in subsequent tutorials.

## Building a Basic Custom Python Model

### Introduction

In this tutorial, we deepen our understanding of MLflow's Custom Pyfunc. The `PythonModel` class serves as the cornerstone, allowing
you to define, save, load, and predict using custom PyFunc models.
We'll be developing a very non-standard model; one that generates plotted figures in order to showcase the flexibility of custom PyFunc models.
By the end, we'll have a functional Lissajous curve generator, wrapped and managed within the Pyfunc framework.

### What you will learn

- **Defining Custom PyFunc Models**: Explore the structure of the `PythonModel` class and its essential methods.
- **Understanding Pyfunc Components**: Get acquainted with the foundational building blocks of the Pyfunc flavor.
- **Saving and Loading Models**: Experience the seamless integration of MLflow's storage and retrieval capabilities.
- **Predicting with Custom Logic**: Interface with the loaded custom Pyfunc to generate interesting Lissajous curve plots.

### The `PythonModel` class

MLflow's commitment to flexibility and standardization shines through the `PythonModel` class. This class, crucial to the Pyfunc
flavor, provides the necessary scaffolding to define custom logic, load resources, and make predictions.

There are two primary ways to create an instance of the PythonModel:

1. **Class-based approach**: Define a class with necessary methods and use it as a blueprint for the model.
2. **Function-based approach**: Capture the entire prediction logic within a single function, letting MLflow handle the rest.

For this tutorial, we'll focus on the class-based approach, delving into methods like `load_context` and `predict` and
understanding their roles in the larger ecosystem.

### Lissajous Curves

As our vehicle for understanding, we'll employ the Lissajous curves â€“ sinusoidal parametric curves whose shapes and orientations are
determined by their parameters. Instead of a conventional machine learning model, this mathematical curve will demonstrate the versatility
and power of the Pyfunc flavor.

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Define the Custom PyFunc Model**: We start by creating a Python class encapsulating the logic for generating Lissajous curves.
2. **Save the Model**: With the model defined, we leverage MLflow's capabilities to save it, ensuring future reproducibility.
3. **Load the Model**: Retrieve the model from storage and prepare it for predictions.
4. **Generate Curves**: Use the loaded model to create and visualize Lissajous curves, showcasing the end-to-end capabilities of the Pyfunc flavor.

### Wrap Up

With a practical example under our belt, the power and flexibility of MLflow's Custom Pyfunc are evident. Whether you're working with
traditional machine learning models or unique use cases like the Lissajous curve generator, Pyfunc ensures a standardized, reproducible,
and efficient workflow.

## Overriding a model's prediction method

### Introduction

Diving deeper into the realm of custom PyFuncs with MLflow, this tutorial addresses a common challenge in model deployment: retaining and
customizing the behavior of a model's prediction method after serialization and deployment. Leveraging the power of MLflow's PyFunc flavor,
we'll learn how to override the default _predict_ behavior, ensuring our model retains all its original capabilities when deployed in
different environments.

### What you will learn

- **The Challenge with Default PyFuncs**: Recognize the limitations of default PyFunc behavior with complex models, especially when methods other than _predict_ are vital.
- **Customizing Predict Method**: Discover the technique to override the default _predict_ method, enabling the support of various prediction methodologies.
- **Harnessing Joblib with PyFunc**: Understand why _joblib_ is preferred over _pickle_ for serializing scikit-learn models and how to integrate it with PyFunc.
- **Dynamic Prediction with Params**: Learn to make the _predict_ method more versatile by accepting parameters that dictate the type of prediction.

### Why Override _predict_?

Models, especially in libraries like scikit-learn, often come with multiple methods for prediction, such as _predict_, _predict_proba_, and _predict_log_proba_.
When deploying such models, it's essential to retain the flexibility to choose the prediction methodology dynamically. This section sheds light
on the need for such flexibility and the challenges with default PyFunc deployments.

### Creating a Custom PyFunc

Venturing into the solution, we craft a custom PyFunc by extending MLflow's _PythonModel_. This custom class serves as a wrapper around the
original model, providing a flexible _predict_ method that can mimic the behavior of various original methods based on provided parameters.

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Prepare a Basic Model**: Use the Iris dataset to create a simple Logistic Regression model, illustrating the different prediction methods.
2. **Challenges with Default Deployment**: Recognize the limitations when deploying the model as a default PyFunc.
3. **Crafting the Custom PyFunc**: Design a ModelWrapper class that can dynamically switch between prediction methods.
4. **Saving and Loading the Custom Model**: Integrate with MLflow to save the custom PyFunc and load it for predictions.
5. **Dynamic Predictions**: Test the loaded model, ensuring it supports all original prediction methods.

### Wrap Up

Overcoming the challenges of default deployments, this tutorial showcases the prowess of custom PyFuncs in MLflow. The ability to override and
customize prediction methods ensures that our deployed models remain as versatile and capable as their original incarnations. As ML workflows
grow in complexity, such customization becomes invaluable, ensuring our deployments are robust and adaptable.
