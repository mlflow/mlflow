# MLflow Plugins

As a framework-agnostic tool for machine learning, the MLflow Python API provides developer APIs for
writing plugins that integrate with different ML frameworks and backends.

Plugins provide a powerful mechanism for customizing the behavior of the MLflow
Python client and integrating third-party tools, allowing you to:

- Integrate with third-party storage solutions for experiment data, artifacts, and models
- Integrate with third-party authentication providers, e.g. read HTTP authentication credentials
  from a special file
- Use the MLflow client to communicate with other REST APIs, e.g. your organization's existing
  experiment-tracking APIs
- Automatically capture additional metadata as run tags, e.g. the git repository associated with a run
- Add new backend to execute MLflow Project entrypoints.

The MLflow Python API supports several types of plugins:

- **Tracking Store**: override tracking backend logic, e.g. to log to a third-party storage solution
- **ArtifactRepository**: override artifact logging logic, e.g. to log to a third-party storage solution
- **Run context providers**: specify context tags to be set on runs created via the
  <APILink fn="mlflow.start_run" /> fluent API.
- **Model Registry Store**: override model registry backend logic, e.g. to log to a third-party storage solution
- **MLflow Project backend**: override the local execution backend to execute a project on your own cluster (Databricks, kubernetes, etc.)
- **MLflow ModelEvaluator**: Define custom model evaluator, which can be used in <APILink fn="mlflow.evaluate" /> API.

## Using an MLflow Plugin

MLflow plugins are Python packages that you can install using PyPI or conda.
This example installs a Tracking Store plugin from source and uses it within an example script.

### Install the Plugin

To get started, clone MLflow and install [this example plugin](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow
cd mlflow
pip install -e tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin
```

### Run Code Using the Plugin

This plugin defines a custom Tracking Store for tracking URIs with the `file-plugin` scheme.
The plugin implementation delegates to MLflow's built-in file-based run storage. To use
the plugin, you can run any code that uses MLflow, setting the tracking URI to one with a
`file-plugin://` scheme:

```bash
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=file-plugin:$(PWD)/mlruns python examples/quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py
```

Launch the MLflow UI:

```bash
cd ..
mlflow server --backend-store-uri ./mlflow/mlruns
```

View results at http://localhost:5000. You should see a newly-created run with a param named
"param1" and a metric named "foo":

### Use Plugin for Client Side Authentication

MLflow provides `RequestAuthProvider` plugin to customize auth header for outgoing http request.

To use it, implement the `RequestAuthProvider` class and override the `get_name` and `get_auth` methods.
`get_name` should return the name of your auth provider, while `get_auth` should return the auth object
that will be added to the http request.

```python
from mlflow.tracking.request_auth.abstract_request_auth_provider import (
    RequestAuthProvider,
)

class DummyAuthProvider(RequestAuthProvider):
    def get_name(self):
        return "dummy_auth_provider_name"

      def get_auth(self):
          return DummyAuth()
```

Once you have the implemented request auth provider class, register it in the `entry_points` and install the plugin.

```python
  setup(
      entry_points={
          "mlflow.request_auth_provider": "dummy-backend=DummyAuthProvider",
      },
  )
```

Then set environment variable `MLFLOW_TRACKING_AUTH` to enable the injection of custom auth.
The value of this environment variable should match the name of the auth provider.

```bash
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_AUTH=dummy_auth_provider_name
```

## Writing Your Own MLflow Plugins

### Defining a Plugin

You define an MLflow plugin as a standalone Python package that can be distributed for
installation via PyPI or conda. See https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin for an
example package that implements all available plugin types.

The example package contains a `setup.py` that declares a number of
[entry points](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins):

```python
setup(
    name="mflow-test-plugin",
    # Require MLflow as a dependency of the plugin, so that plugin users can simply install
    # the plugin and then immediately use it with MLflow
    install_requires=["mlflow"],
    ...,
    entry_points={
        # Define a Tracking Store plugin for tracking URIs with scheme 'file-plugin'
        "mlflow.tracking_store": "file-plugin=mlflow_test_plugin.file_store:PluginFileStore",
        # Define a ArtifactRepository plugin for artifact URIs with scheme 'file-plugin'
        "mlflow.artifact_repository": "file-plugin=mlflow_test_plugin.local_artifact:PluginLocalArtifactRepository",
        # Define a RunContextProvider plugin. The entry point name for run context providers
        # is not used, and so is set to the string "unused" here
        "mlflow.run_context_provider": "unused=mlflow_test_plugin.run_context_provider:PluginRunContextProvider",
        # Define a RequestHeaderProvider plugin. The entry point name for request header providers
        # is not used, and so is set to the string "unused" here
        "mlflow.request_header_provider": "unused=mlflow_test_plugin.request_header_provider:PluginRequestHeaderProvider",
        # Define a RequestAuthProvider plugin. The entry point name for request auth providers
        # is not used, and so is set to the string "unused" here
        "mlflow.request_auth_provider": "unused=mlflow_test_plugin.request_auth_provider:PluginRequestAuthProvider",
        # Define a Model Registry Store plugin for tracking URIs with scheme 'file-plugin'
        "mlflow.model_registry_store": "file-plugin=mlflow_test_plugin.sqlalchemy_store:PluginRegistrySqlAlchemyStore",
        # Define a MLflow Project Backend plugin called 'dummy-backend'
        "mlflow.project_backend": "dummy-backend=mlflow_test_plugin.dummy_backend:PluginDummyProjectBackend",
        # Define a MLflow model deployment plugin for target 'faketarget'
        "mlflow.deployments": "faketarget=mlflow_test_plugin.fake_deployment_plugin",
        # Define a MLflow model evaluator with name "dummy_evaluator"
        "mlflow.model_evaluator": "dummy_evaluator=mlflow_test_plugin.dummy_evaluator:DummyEvaluator",
    },
)
```

Each element of this `entry_points` dictionary specifies a single plugin. You
can choose to implement one or more plugin types in your package, and need not implement them all.
The type of plugin defined by each entry point and its corresponding reference implementation in
MLflow are described below. You can work from the reference implementations when writing your own
plugin:

        of `mlflow.models.EvaluationResult`. Accepts the following arguments: `model` (a pyfunc model instance),
        `model_type` (identical to the `model_type` argument from <APILink fn="mlflow.evaluate" />),
        `dataset` (an instance of `mlflow.data.evaluation_dataset._EvaluationDataset` containing features and labels (optional) for model evaluation),

        and may add custom configuration, middleware etc. to the app. The plugin should avoid altering the existing application routes, handlers and environment variables to avoid
        unexpected behavior. Users who install the example plugin will have a customized flask application. To run the customized flask application, use `mlflow server --app-name <app_name>`.

### Testing Your Plugin

We recommend testing your plugin to ensure that it follows the contract expected by MLflow. For
example, a Tracking Store plugin should contain tests verifying correctness of its
`log_metric`, `log_param`, ... etc implementations. See also the tests for MLflow's
reference implementations as an example:

- [Example Tracking Store tests](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/store/tracking/test_file_store.py)
- [Example ArtifactRepository tests](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/store/artifact/test_local_artifact_repo.py)
- [Example RunContextProvider tests](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/tracking/context/test_git_context.py)
- [Example Model Registry Store tests](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.5/tests/store/model_registry/test_sqlalchemy_store.py)
- [Example Custom MLflow Evaluator tests](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.23/tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin/mlflow_test_plugin/dummy_evaluator.py)
- [Example Custom MLflow server tests](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-2.2.0/tests/server/test_handlers.py)

### Distributing Your Plugin

Assuming you've structured your plugin similarly to the example plugin, you can
[distribute it via PyPI](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools).

Congrats, you've now written and distributed your own MLflow plugin!

## Community Plugins

### SQL Server Plugin

The [mlflow-dbstore plugin](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow-dbstore/) allows MLflow to use a relational database as an artifact store.
As of now, it has only been tested with SQL Server as the artifact store.

You can install MLflow with the SQL Server plugin via:

```bash
pip install mlflow[sqlserver]
```

and then use MLflow as normal. The SQL Server artifact store support will be provided automatically.

The plugin implements all of the MLflow artifact store APIs. To use SQL server as an artifact store, a database URI must be provided, as shown in the example below:

```python
db_uri = "mssql+pyodbc://username:password@host:port/database?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server"

client.create_experiment(exp_name, artifact_location=db_uri)
mlflow.set_experiment(exp_name)

mlflow.onnx.log_model(onnx, "model")
```

The first time an artifact is logged in the artifact store, the plugin automatically creates an `artifacts` table in the database specified by the database URI and stores the artifact there as a BLOB.
Subsequent logged artifacts are stored in the same table.

In the example provided above, the `log_model` operation creates three entries in the database table to store the ONNX model, the MLmodel file
and the conda.yaml file associated with the model.

### Aliyun(Alibaba Cloud) OSS Plugin

The [aliyunstoreplugin](https://pypi.org/project/aliyunstoreplugin/) allows MLflow to use Alibaba Cloud OSS storage as an artifact store.

```bash
pip install mlflow[aliyun-oss]
```

and then use MLflow as normal. The Alibaba Cloud OSS artifact store support will be provided automatically.

The plugin implements all of the MLflow artifact store APIs.
It expects Aliyun Storage access credentials in the `MLFLOW_OSS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `MLFLOW_OSS_KEY_ID` and `MLFLOW_OSS_KEY_SECRET` environment variables,
so you must set these variables on both your client application and your MLflow tracking server.
To use Aliyun OSS as an artifact store, an OSS URI of the form `oss://<bucket>/<path>` must be provided, as shown in the example below:

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.pyfunc


class Mod(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):
    def predict(self, ctx, inp, params=None):
        return 7


exp_name = "myexp"
mlflow.create_experiment(exp_name, artifact_location="oss://mlflow-test/")
mlflow.set_experiment(exp_name)
mlflow.pyfunc.log_model("model_test", python_model=Mod())
```

In the example provided above, the `log_model` operation creates three entries in the OSS storage
`oss://mlflow-test/$RUN_ID/artifacts/model_test/`, the MLmodel file and the conda.yaml
file associated with the model.

### XetHub Plugin

The [xethub plugin](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow-xethub/) allows MLflow to use XetHub storage as an artifact store.

```bash
pip install mlflow[xethub]
```

and then use MLflow as normal. The XetHub artifact store support will be provided automatically.

The plugin implements all of the MLflow artifact store APIs.
It expects XetHub access credentials through `xet login` CLI command or in the `XET_USER_EMAIL`, `XET_USER_NAME` and `XET_USER_TOKEN` environment variables,
so you must authenticate with XetHub for both your client application and your MLflow tracking server.
To use XetHub as an artifact store, an XetHub URI of the form `xet://<username>/<repo>/<branch>` must be provided, as shown in the example below:

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.pyfunc


class Mod(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):
    def predict(self, ctx, inp, params=None):
        return 7


exp_name = "myexp"
mlflow.create_experiment(
    exp_name, artifact_location="xet://<your_username>/mlflow-test/main"
)
mlflow.set_experiment(exp_name)
mlflow.pyfunc.log_model("model_test", python_model=Mod())
```

In the example provided above, the `log_model` operation creates three entries in the OSS storage `xet://mlflow-test/$RUN_ID/artifacts/model_test/`, the MLmodel file
and the conda.yaml file associated with the model.

### Artifact Repository Plugins

- [oci-mlflow](https://github.com/oracle/oci-mlflow) Leverages Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage service to store MLflow models artifacts.

### JFrog Artifactory MLflow plugin

- [mlflow-jfrog-plugin](https://github.com/jfrog/mlflow-jfrog-plugin) Optimize your artifact governance by seamlessly storing them in your preferred repository within JFrog Artifactory.

**Overview**

The JFrog MLflow plugin extends MLflow functionality by replacing the default artifacts location of MLflow with JFrog Artifactory.
Once MLflow experiments artifacts are available inside JFrog Artifactory, they become an integral part of the company's release lifecycle as any other artifact and are also covered by all the security tools provided through the JFrog platform.

**Features**

- Experiments artifacts log/save are performed against JFrog Artifactory
- Experiments artifacts viewing and downloading using MLflow UI and APIs as well as JFrog UI and APIs are done against JFrog Artifactory
- Experiments Artifacts deletion follow experiments lifecycle (automatically or through mlflow gc)
- Changing specific experiments artifacts destination is allowed through experiment creation command (by changing artifact_location)

**Installation**

Install the plugin using pip, installation should be done on the mlflow tracking server.
optionally the plugin can be installed on any client that wants to change the default artifacts location for a specific artifactory repository

```bash
pip install mlflow[jfrog]
```

or

```bash
pip install mlflow-jfrog-plugin
```

Set the JFrog Artifactory authentication token, using the ARTIFACTORY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable:
Preferably, for security reasons use a token with minimum permissions required rather than an admin token

```bash
export ARTIFACTORY_AUTH_TOKEN=<your artifactory token goes here>
```

Once the plugin is installed and token set, your mlflow tracking server can be started with JFrog artifactory repository as a target artifacts destination
USe the mlflowdocumentation for additional mlflow server options

```bash
mlflow server --host <mlflow tracking server host> --port <mlflow tracking server port> --artifacts-destination artifactory://<JFrog artifactory URL>/artifactory/<repository[/optional base path]>
```

For allowing large artifacts upload to JFrog artifactory, it is advisable to increase upload timeout settings when starting th mlflow server:
--gunicorn-opts '--timeout \<timeout in seconds\>'

**Usage**

MLflow model logging code example:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow import MlflowClient
from transformers import pipeline

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("<your mlflow tracking server uri>")
mlflow.create_experiment("<your_exp_name>")
classifier = pipeline(
    "sentiment-analysis", model="michellejieli/emotion_text_classifier"
)

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.transformers.log_model(
        transformers_model=classifier, artifact_path=MODEL_NAME
    )
mlflow.end_run()
```

**Configuration**

Additional optional settings (set on mlflow tracking server before its started):
to use no-ssl artifactory URL, set ARTIFACTORY_NO_SSL to true. default is false

```bash
export ARTIFACTORY_NO_SSL=true
```

to allow JFrog operations debug logging, set ARTIFACTORY_DEBUG to true. default is false

```bash
export ARTIFACTORY_DEBUG=true
```

to prevent MLflow garbage collection remove any artifacts from being removed from artifactory, set ARTIFACTORY_ARTIFACTS_DELETE_SKIP to true. default is false
Notice this settings might cause significant storage usage and might require JFrog files retention setup.

```bash
export ARTIFACTORY_ARTIFACTS_DELETE_SKIP=true
```
