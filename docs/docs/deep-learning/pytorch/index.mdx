# MLflow PyTorch Flavor

## Introduction

`PyTorch` is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible
and intuitive framework for deep learning and is particularly favored for its dynamic computation graph (eager mode),
which provides a more pythonic development flow compared to static graph frameworks (graph mode). PyTorch is
efficient for large-scale data processing and neural network training. Due to its ease of use and robust
community support, PyTorch has become a popular choice among researchers and developers in the AI field.

MLflow has built-in support (we call it MLflow PyTorch flavor) for PyTorch workflow, at a high level
in MLflow we provide a set of APIs for:

- **Simplified Experiment Tracking**: Log parameters, metrics, and models during model training.
- **Experiments Management**: Store your PyTorch experiments in MLflow server, and you can view and share them from MLflow UI.
- **Effortless Deployment**: Deploy PyTorch models with simple API calls, catering to a variety of production environments.
