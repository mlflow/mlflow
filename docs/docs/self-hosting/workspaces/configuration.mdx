# Workspace Configuration

Reference for the core flags, env vars, and startup checks for workspace mode. For setup and end-to-end flows, see [Getting Started](/self-hosting/workspaces/getting-started). For provider details and artifact routing options, see [Workspace Providers](/self-hosting/workspaces/workspace-providers).

## Server Configuration (enable/disable)

Enable workspaces with the flag:

```bash
mlflow server \
  --backend-store-uri postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mlflow \
  --default-artifact-root s3://mlflow-artifacts \
  --enable-workspaces
```

Or with env vars:

```bash
export MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=true
mlflow server \
  --backend-store-uri ... \
  --default-artifact-root ...
```

Disable by restarting without `--enable-workspaces` after moving all resources into the `default` workspace.

### Admin Utility: migrate to default workspace

To move all workspace-scoped resources into `default` to disable workspaces, use:

```bash
mlflow db migrate-to-default-workspace <database_uri>
```

By default, the command prints the rows to be moved and asks for confirmation. Use `-y` to skip
the prompt.

Run a dry run first to surface conflicts and see how many rows will be updated:

```bash
mlflow db migrate-to-default-workspace <database_uri> --dry-run
```

Use `--verbose` to list all conflicts instead of a truncated sample.

## Client Workspace Selection (summary)

- Explicit: `mlflow.set_workspace("team-a")`
- Env var: `MLFLOW_WORKSPACE=team-a`
- Provider default: `get_default_workspace()` (SQL provider returns `default`)

Clients send `X-MLFLOW-WORKSPACE` on REST calls; UI AJAX routes remain the same (`/api`, `/ajax-api`).

## Startup Validation (when `--enable-workspaces`)

- Tracking and registry stores must report `supports_workspaces() == True`
- Workspace provider resolved (defaults to SQL-backed provider if none given)
- Reserved `default` workspace exists (created by migration)
- With `--serve-artifacts`, proxied artifact paths for non-default workspaces must include `workspaces/<workspace>/...`; legacy unprefixed paths remain valid for `default`.

## Admin preflight for artifact roots

Before enabling workspaces, confirm that existing experiment artifact locations do not already
live under the reserved `<default_artifact_root>/workspaces/<workspace>/...` path unless
they match the workspace layout you intend to use. If they do, move or rename those artifact
roots first to avoid collisions.

## Artifact Behavior

- By default, new experiments land under `<default_artifact_root>/workspaces/<workspace>/<experiment_id>`; runs inherit that path.
- Existing experiments/runs keep their stored locations (legacy unprefixed paths under `default` continue to work).
- To override the artifact root for a specific workspace, set `default_artifact_root` on the workspace (via `mlflow.create_workspace(...)` / `mlflow.update_workspace(...)` or the workspace REST API). When set, MLflow uses `<workspace_default_artifact_root>/<experiment_id>` (no `/workspaces/<workspace>` prefix) for new experiments in that workspace.

## API Limitations

- `create_experiment()` disallows `artifact_location` while workspaces are enabled; MLflow assigns workspace-scoped locations.

## Detecting Workspace Support Programmatically

- Call `GET /api/3.0/mlflow/server-features` to check `workspaces_enabled`.
- The endpoint is reachable without a workspace header; a `404` indicates an older server without workspace support.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                     | Description                                                                  | Default                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES`   | Enable workspace mode                                                        | `false`                                    |
| `MLFLOW_WORKSPACE`           | Active workspace for client operations                                       | None                                       |
| `MLFLOW_WORKSPACE_STORE_URI` | Override the workspace provider URI; falls back to the resolved tracking URI | None (falls back to resolved tracking URI) |

`MLFLOW_WORKSPACE` chooses the target workspace. `MLFLOW_WORKSPACE_STORE_URI` selects where the workspace catalog lives (and which provider to use), not which workspace; if unset, the tracking URI is reused. Providers are discovered via the `mlflow.workspace_provider` entry point.
