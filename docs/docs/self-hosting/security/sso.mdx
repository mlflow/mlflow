# SSO (Single Sign-On)

You can use SSO (Single Sign-On) to authenticate users to your MLflow instance, by installing a custom plugin or using a reverse proxy.

## Using OIDC Plugin

MLflow supports SSO (Single Sign-On) with custom plugins for authentication. The [mlflow-oidc-auth](https://github.com/mlflow-oidc/mlflow-oidc-auth) plugin provides OIDC support for MLflow.

**Features**:

- OIDC-based authentication for MLflow UI and API
- User management through OIDC provider
- User-level access control
- Group-based access control
- Permissions management based on regular expressions (allows or denies access to specific MLflow resources based on regular expressions and assigns permissions to users or groups)
- Support for session, JWT, and basic authentication methods
- Compatible with mlflow-client (basic auth)

:::note

This plugin is maintained by the community.

:::

```bash
pip install mlflow-oidc-auth[full]
mlflow server --app-name oidc-auth --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Reverse proxy pattern

Another common approach is to place MLflow behind a proxy that handles SSO and forwards authenticated requests. The most popular way is to use [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) reverse proxy.

1. Configure your proxy (NGINX, Traefik, Envoy, or cloud gateways such as AWS ALB with OIDC) to authenticate users against your IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace).
2. After a successful login, inject user identity headers (for example, `X-Email` or `X-Forwarded-User`) and restrict access to authenticated sessions only.
3. Run MLflow without the Basic Auth app and rely on the proxy as the enforcement layer, or map the incoming identity header to a Basic Auth user using a custom middleware.

This pattern keeps MLflow stateless while deferring token validation and MFA enforcement to systems designed for it. You can find the reference implementation in [this repository](https://github.com/cloudacode/mlflow-oauth-sidecar).
