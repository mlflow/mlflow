# MLflow 3.0 (Preview)

Discover the next generation of MLflow, designed to streamline your AI experimentation and accelerate your journey from idea to production. MLflow 3.0 brings cutting-edge support for GenAI workflows, enabling seamless integration of generative AI models into your projects.

## What is MLflow 3.0?

MLflow 3.0 delivers best-in-class experiment tracking, observability, and performance evaluation for machine learning models, AI applications, and generative AI agents!
With MLflow 3.0, it's now easier than ever to:
- Centrally track and analyze the performance of your models, agents, and generative AI applications **across all environments**, from interactive queries in a development notebook through production batch or real-time serving deployments.
- Select the best models, agents, and generative AI applications for production with an **enhanced performance comparison experience** powered by MLflow's tracing and evaluation capabilities.

MLflow 3.0's enhanced model tracking helps you manage and evaluate different model, agent, and generative AI application configurations in your experiments.
Improved comparison workflows with the new <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.LoggedModel">LoggedModel</APILink> enable you to quickly identify the best candidates for production,
and MLflow tracing provides rich observability everywhere that your models, agents, and generative AI applications are deployed.

## Enhanced Model Tracking

In MLflow 3.0, we introduce a refined architecture along with revamped APIs and UI, tailored to enhance generative AI and deep learning workflows.
With GenAI agents, there are multiple rounds of offline evaluation via batch jobs and interactive queries from human beta testers.
In deep learning, training often generates multiple model checkpoints, where the best candidates are further evaluated before production deployment.

We are introducing a new first-class object, the <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.LoggedModel">LoggedModel</APILink> entity, into MLflow Tracking to streamline these processes. As you define and evaluate your GenAI agents in code,
or your deep learning jobs create and evaluate models, they will be automatically stored as MLflow Logged Models in your MLflow Experiment.

When developing a new version of a GenAI agent or application, you can group all of the traces and metrics from interactive queries and automated evaluation jobs using MLflow's <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.LoggedModel">LoggedModel</APILink> API.
This enables rich, comprehensive comparisons across versions.
Similarly, every deep learning checkpoint is stored as a <APILink fn="mlflow.entities.LoggedModel">LoggedModel</APILink> with its own metrics and parameters, simplifying the process of identifying the best checkpoint for deployment or continued training.

### Manual control over trace grouping

To manually control trace grouping, you can use <APILink fn="mlflow.set_active_model">mlflow.set_active_model</APILink> API to **set an active LoggedModel in the current context**.
This API supports passing either the `name` or `model_id` of a LoggedModel. If no LoggedModel with the given name exists, MLflow automatically creates an external model (without artifacts) using the specified name.
If multiple LoggedModels share the same name, MLflow sets the **latest** one as the active model. When providing a `model_id`, ensure that a corresponding LoggedModel exists, otherwise an exception will
be raised.

To manually create a LoggedModel beforehand, use <APILink fn="mlflow.create_external_model">mlflow.create_external_model</APILink> if you store the model's artifacts outside of MLflow, or use `mlflow.<flavor>.log_model` to log
the model and artifacts directly.

Once an active model is set, all generated traces will be associated with this model and displayed in its `Traces` tab in the UI when autologging is enabled (e.g. <APILink fn="mlflow.langchain.autolog">mlflow.langchain.autolog</APILink>).
Additionally, evaluation metrics produced by <APILink fn="mlflow.evaluate">mlflow.evaluate</APILink> will appear on the LoggedModel's page, providing insights into the model's performance.

### Quickstart

#### Prerequisites
Run the following command to install MLflow 3.0 and OpenAI packages.
```
pip install --upgrade 'mlflow>=3.0.0rc0' --pre
pip install openai
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in CLI to authenticate to OpenAI APIs.
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

This quickstart demonstrates how to create a generative AI application with prompt engineering and evaluate it using MLflow 3.0.
It highlights the integration of the LoggedModel lineage feature with runs and traces, showcasing seamless tracking and observability for GenAI workflows.

#### Register a prompt template

First, we create a prompt template and register it with [MLflow Prompt Registry](../prompts).

```python
import mlflow

# define a prompt template
prompt_template = """\
You are an expert AI assistant. Answer the user's question with clarity, accuracy, and conciseness.

## Question:
{{question}}

## Guidelines:
- Keep responses factual and to the point.
- If relevant, provide examples or step-by-step instructions.
- If the question is ambiguous, clarify before answering.

Respond below:
"""

# register the prompt
prompt = mlflow.register_prompt(
    name="ai_assistant_prompt",
    template=prompt_template,
    commit_message="Initial version of AI assistant",
)
```
Switch to the **Prompts** tab to view the registered prompt:

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>
    ![The MLflow UI showing a prompt version](/images/mlflow-3/ai_assistant_prompt.png)
</div>

#### Make a request to OpenAI

At this step, we set an active model for grouping traces.
After enabling autologging, all traces generated during requests will be linked to the active model.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# set an active model for linking traces, a model named `openai_model` will be created
mlflow.set_active_model(name="openai_model")

# turn on autologging for automatic tracing
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Initialize OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

question = "What is MLflow?"
response = (
    client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt.format(question=question)}],
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=2000,
    )
    .choices[0]
    .message.content
)

# get the active model id
active_model_id = mlflow.get_active_model_id()
print(f"Current active model id: {active_model_id}")

mlflow.search_traces(model_id=active_model_id)
#                            trace_id                                             trace  ...  assessments                        request_id
# 0  7bb4569d3d884e3e87b1d8752276a13c  Trace(trace_id=7bb4569d3d884e3e87b1d8752276a13c)  ...           []  7bb4569d3d884e3e87b1d8752276a13c
# [1 rows x 12 columns]
```

Generated traces can be viewed in the **Traces** tab of the logged model:

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>
    ![The MLflow UI showing the logged model traces](/images/mlflow-3/simple_example_traces.png)
</div>

#### Evaluate the response with GenAI metrics

Finally, we evaluate the response using different metrics and record the results to a run and the current active model.

```python
from mlflow.metrics.genai import answer_correctness, answer_similarity, faithfulness

# ground truth result for evaluation
mlflow_ground_truth = (
    "MLflow is an open-source platform for managing "
    "the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It was developed by Databricks, "
    "a company that specializes in big data and machine learning solutions. MLflow is "
    "designed to address the challenges that data scientists and machine learning "
    "engineers face when developing, training, and deploying machine learning models."
)

# Define evaluation metrics
metrics = {
    "answer_similarity": answer_similarity(model="openai:/gpt-4o"),
    "answer_correctness": answer_correctness(model="openai:/gpt-4o"),
    "faithfulness": faithfulness(model="openai:/gpt-4o"),
}
# Calculate metrics based on the input, response and ground truth
# The evaluation metrics are callables that can be invoked directly
answer_similarity_score = metrics["answer_similarity"](
    predictions=response, inputs=question, targets=mlflow_ground_truth
).scores[0]
answer_correctness_score = metrics["answer_correctness"](
    predictions=response, inputs=question, targets=mlflow_ground_truth
).scores[0]
faithfulness_score = metrics["faithfulness"](
    predictions=response, inputs=question, context=mlflow_ground_truth
).scores[0]

# Start a run to represent the evaluation process
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    # Log metrics and pass model_id to link the metrics
    mlflow.log_metrics(
        {
            "answer_similarity": answer_similarity_score,
            "answer_correctness": answer_correctness_score,
            "faithfulness": faithfulness_score,
        },
        model_id=active_model_id,
    )
```

Navigate to the **Models** tab of the experiment to view the newly created LoggedModel. Evaluation metrics, model ID, source run, parameters, and other details are displayed on the models detail page, providing a comprehensive overview of the model's performance and lineage.

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>

</div>
<div className="center-div" style={{ width: "100%" }}>
    ![The MLflow UI showing the logged model](/images/mlflow-3/simple_example_model.png)
</div>

Clicking on the source_run takes you to the evaluation run's page with all the metrics:

      Pass **name** when logging a model. This allows you to later search for LoggedModels using this name, `artifact_path` parameter is deprecated.

        :::note

            MLflow no longer requires starting a Run before logging models, because Models become
            first citizen entity in MLflow 3. You can directly call the `log_model` API without
            `mlflow.start_run()` context manager to log a model.

        :::
        ```
        mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(
            name="model",
            python_model=python_model,
            ...
        )
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Model artifacts storage location</td>
      <td>[model artifacts](../model/#storage-format) are stored as run artifacts.</td>
      <td>Model artifacts are stored into models artifacts location. Note: this impacts the behavior of <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.list_artifacts">list_artifacts</APILink> API.</td>
