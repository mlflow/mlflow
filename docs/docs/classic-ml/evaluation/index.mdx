## Core Evaluation Capabilities

### Automated Model Assessment

MLflow evaluation transforms complex model assessment into simple, reproducible workflows:

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine

# Load and prepare data
wine = load_wine()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    wine.data, wine.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create evaluation dataset
eval_data = X_test
eval_data["target"] = y_test

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, name="model")

    # Comprehensive evaluation with one line
    result = mlflow.models.evaluate(
        model="models:/my-model/1",
        data=eval_data,
        targets="target",
        model_type="classifier",
        evaluators=["default"],
    )
```
