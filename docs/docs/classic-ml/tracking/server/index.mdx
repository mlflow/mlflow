# MLflow Tracking Server

MLflow tracking server is a stand-alone HTTP server that serves multiple REST API endpoints for tracking runs/experiments.
While MLflow Tracking can be used in local environment, hosting a tracking server is powerful in the team development
workflow:

- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can log runs to the same endpoint, and query runs and models logged by other users.
- **Sharing Results**: The tracking server also serves [Tracking UI](/ml/tracking#tracking_ui) endpoint, where team members can easily explore each other's results.
- **Centralized Access**: The tracking server can be run as a proxy for the remote access for metadata and artifacts, making it easier to secure and audit access to data.

## Start the Tracking Server

Starting the tracking server is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

Once the server starts running, you should see the following output:

```
INFO:     Started server process [28550]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

There are many options to configure the server, refer to [Configure Server](#configure-server) for more details.

:::warning important
The server listens on http://localhost:5000 by default and only accepts
connections from the local machine. To let the server accept connections
from other machines, you will need to pass `--host 0.0.0.0` to listen on
all network interfaces (or a specific interface address). This is typically
required configuration when running the server **in a Kubernetes pod or a
Docker container**.

Note that doing this for a server running on a public network is not recommended
for security reasons. You should consider using a reverse proxy like NGINX or Apache
httpd, or connecting over VPN (See [Secure Tracking Server](#tracking-auth) for more details).
:::

## Logging to a Tracking Server \{#logging_to_a_tracking_server}

Once the tracking server is started, connect your local clients by setting the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable to the
server's URI, along with its scheme and port (for example, `http://10.0.0.1:5000`) or call <APILink fn="mlflow.set_tracking_uri" />.

The <APILink fn="mlflow.start_run" />, <APILink fn="mlflow.log_param" />, and <APILink fn="mlflow.log_metric" /> calls
then make API requests to your remote tracking server.

## Configure Server

This section describes how to configure the tracking server for some common use cases. Please run `mlflow server --help` for the full list of command line options.

### Backend Store

By default, the tracking server logs runs metadata to the local filesystem under `./mlruns` directory.
You can configure the different backend store by adding `--backend-store-uri` option:

```bash title="Example"
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///my.db
```

This will create a SQLite database `my.db` in the current directory, and logging requests from clients will be pointed to this database.

### Remote artifacts store \{#tracking-server-artifact-store}

#### Using the Tracking Server for proxied artifact access

By default, the tracking server stores artifacts in its local filesystem under `./mlartifacts` directory. To configure
the tracking server to connect to remote storage and serve artifacts, start the server with `--artifacts-destination` flag.

```bash
mlflow server \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8885 \
    --artifacts-destination s3://my-bucket
```

With this setting, MLflow server works as a proxy for accessing remote artifacts. The MLflow clients make HTTP request to the server for fetching artifacts.

:::warning important
If you are using remote storage, you have to configure the credentials for the server to access the artifacts. Be aware of that The MLflow artifact proxied
access service enables users to have an _assumed role of access to all artifacts_ that are accessible to the Tracking Server. Refer [Manage Access](/ml/tracking/artifact-stores#artifacts-stores-manage-access) for further details.
:::

The tracking server resolves the uri `mlflow-artifacts:/` in tracking request from the client to an otherwise
explicit object store destination (e.g., "s3:/my_bucket/mlartifacts") for interfacing with artifacts. The following patterns will all resolve to the configured proxied object store location (in above example, `s3://my-root-bucket/mlartifacts`):

- `https://<host>:<port>/mlartifacts`
- `http://<host>/mlartifacts`
- `mlflow-artifacts://<host>/mlartifacts`
- `mlflow-artifacts://<host>:<port>/mlartifacts`
- `mlflow-artifacts:/mlartifacts`

:::warning important
The MLflow client caches artifact location information on a per-run basis.
It is therefore not recommended to alter a run's artifact location before it has terminated.
:::

#### Use tracking server w/o proxying artifacts access \{#tracking-server-no-proxy}

In some cases, you may want to directly access remote storage without proxying through the tracking server.
In this case, you can start the server with `--no-serve-artifacts` flag, and setting `--default-artifact-root` to the remote storage URI
you want to redirect the request to.

```bash
mlflow server --no-serve-artifacts --default-artifact-root s3://my-bucket
```

With this setting, the MLflow client still makes minimum HTTP requests to the tracking server for fetching proper remote storage URI,
but can directly upload artifacts to / download artifacts from the remote storage. While this might not be a good practice for access and
secury governance, it could be useful when you want to avoid the overhead of proxying artifacts through the tracking server.

:::note
If the MLflow server is _not configured_ with the `--serve-artifacts` option, the client directly pushes artifacts
to the artifact store. It does not proxy these through the tracking server by default.

For this reason, the client needs direct access to the artifact store. For instructions on setting up these credentials,
see [Artifact Stores documentation](/ml/tracking/artifact-stores#artifacts-stores-manage-access).
:::

:::note
When an experiment is created, the artifact storage location from the configuration of the tracking server is logged in the experiment's metadata.
When enabling proxied artifact storage, any existing experiments that were created while operating a tracking server in
non-proxied mode will continue to use a non-proxied artifact location. In order to use proxied artifact logging, a new experiment must be created.
If the intention of enabling a tracking server in `-serve-artifacts` mode is to eliminate the need for a client to have authentication to
the underlying storage, new experiments should be created for use by clients so that the tracking server can handle authentication after this migration.
:::

#### Optionally using a Tracking Server instance exclusively for artifact handling \{#tracking-server-artifacts-only}

MLflow Tracking Server can be configured to use different backend store and artifact store, and provides a single endpoint for the clients.

However, if the volume of tracking server requests is sufficiently large and performance issues are noticed, a tracking server
can be configured to serve in `--artifacts-only` mode, operating in tandem with an instance that
operates with `--no-serve-artifacts` specified. This configuration ensures that the processing of artifacts is isolated
from all other tracking server event handling.

When a tracking server is configured in `--artifacts-only` mode, any tasks apart from those concerned with artifact
handling (i.e., model logging, loading models, logging artifacts, listing artifacts, etc.) will return an HTTPError.
See the following example of a client REST call in Python attempting to list experiments from a server that is configured in
`--artifacts-only` mode:

```bash
# Launch the artifact-only server
mlflow server --artifacts-only ...
```

```python
import requests

# Attempt to list experiments from the server
response = requests.get("http://0.0.0.0:8885/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/list")
```

```_ title="Output"
>> HTTPError: Endpoint: /api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/list disabled due to the mlflow server running in `--artifacts-only` mode.
```

Using an additional MLflow server to handle artifacts exclusively can be useful for large-scale MLOps infrastructure.
Decoupling the longer running and more compute-intensive tasks of artifact handling from the faster and higher-volume
metadata functionality of the other Tracking API requests can help minimize the burden of an otherwise single MLflow
server handling both types of payloads.

:::note
If an MLflow server is running with the `--artifacts-only` flag, the client should interact with this server explicitly by
including either a `host` or `host:port` definition for uri location references for artifacts.
Otherwise, all artifact requests will route to the MLflow Tracking server, defeating the purpose of running a distinct artifact server.
:::

## Secure Tracking Server \{#tracking-auth}

The `--host` option exposes the service on all interfaces. If running a server in production, we
would recommend not exposing the built-in server broadly (as it is unauthenticated and unencrypted),
and instead putting it behind a reverse proxy like NGINX or Apache httpd, or connecting over VPN.

You can then pass authentication headers to MLflow using these environment variables .

- `MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME` and `MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD` - username and password to use with HTTP
  Basic authentication. To use Basic authentication, you must set `both` environment variables .
- `MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN` - token to use with HTTP Bearer authentication. Basic authentication takes precedence if set.
- `MLFLOW_TRACKING_INSECURE_TLS` - If set to the literal `true`, MLflow does not verify the TLS connection,
  meaning it does not validate certificates or hostnames for `https://` tracking URIs. This flag is not recommended for
  production environments. If this is set to `true` then `MLFLOW_TRACKING_SERVER_CERT_PATH` must not be set.
- `MLFLOW_TRACKING_SERVER_CERT_PATH` - Path to a CA bundle to use. Sets the `verify` param of the
  `requests.request` function
  (see [requests main interface](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/api)).
  When you use a self-signed server certificate you can use this to verify it on client side.
  If this is set `MLFLOW_TRACKING_INSECURE_TLS` must not be set (false).
- `MLFLOW_TRACKING_CLIENT_CERT_PATH` - Path to ssl client cert file (.pem). Sets the `cert` param
  of the `requests.request` function
  (see [requests main interface](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/api)).
  This can be used to use a (self-signed) client certificate.

## Tracking Server versioning

The version of MLflow running on the server can be found by querying the `/version` endpoint.
This can be used to check that the client-side version of MLflow is up-to-date with a remote tracking server prior to running experiments.
For example:

```python
import requests
import mlflow

response = requests.get("http://<mlflow-host>:<mlflow-port>/version")
assert response.text == mlflow.__version__  # Checking for a strict version match
```

## Model Version Source Validation

The tracking server can be configured to validate model version sources using a regular expression pattern. This security feature helps ensure that only model versions from approved sources are registered in your model registry.

### Configuration

Set the `MLFLOW_CREATE_MODEL_VERSION_SOURCE_VALIDATION_REGEX` environment variable when starting the tracking server:

```bash
export MLFLOW_CREATE_MODEL_VERSION_SOURCE_VALIDATION_REGEX="^mlflow-artifacts:/.*$"
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

### Usage

When this environment variable is set, the tracking server will validate the `source` parameter in model version creation requests against the specified regular expression pattern. If the source doesn't match the pattern, the request will be rejected with an error.

#### Example: Restricting to MLflow Artifacts

To only allow model versions from MLflow artifacts storage:

```bash
export MLFLOW_CREATE_MODEL_VERSION_SOURCE_VALIDATION_REGEX="^mlflow-artifacts:/.*$"
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

With this configuration:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient("http://localhost:5000")

# This will work - source matches the pattern
client.create_model_version(
    name="my-model",
    source="mlflow-artifacts://1/artifacts/model",
    run_id="abc123",
)

# This will fail - source doesn't match the pattern
client.create_model_version(
    name="my-model",
    source="s3://my-bucket/model",
    run_id="def456",
)  # Raises MlflowException: Invalid model version source
```

#### Example: Restricting to Specific S3 Buckets

To only allow model versions from specific S3 buckets:

```bash
export MLFLOW_CREATE_MODEL_VERSION_SOURCE_VALIDATION_REGEX="^s3://(production-models|staging-models)/.*$"
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

This pattern would allow sources like:

- `s3://production-models/model-v1/`
- `s3://staging-models/experiment-123/model/`

But reject sources like:

- `s3://untrusted-bucket/model/`
- `file:///local/path/model`

:::note

- If the environment variable is not set, no source validation is performed.
- The validation only applies to the `/mlflow/model-versions/create` API endpoint.
- The regular expression is applied using Python's `re.search()` function.
- Use standard regular expression syntax for pattern matching.
  :::

## Handling timeout when uploading/downloading large artifacts

When uploading or downloading large artifacts through the tracking server with the artifact proxy enabled, the server may take a long time to process the request. If it exceeds the timeout limit, the server will terminate the request, resulting in a request failure on the client side.

Example client code:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("<TRACKING_SERVER_URI>")
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_artifact("large.txt")
```

Client traceback:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/user/python3.10/site-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 486, in send
    resp = conn.urlopen(
  File "/Users/user/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 826, in urlopen
    return self.urlopen(

  File "/Users/user/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 798, in urlopen
    retries = retries.increment(

    raise MaxRetryError(_pool, url, error or ResponseError(cause))
urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='mlflow.example.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: ... (Caused by SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, 'EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:2426)')))
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
```

Tracking server logs:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [82]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
...
WARNING:  Request timeout exceeded
ERROR:    Exception in ASGI application
```

To mitigate this issue, the timeout length can be increased by using the `--uvicorn-opts` option when starting the server as shown below:

```bash
mlflow server --uvicorn-opts "--timeout-keep-alive=120" ...
```

For users still using gunicorn (via `--gunicorn-opts`), the equivalent command would be:

```bash
mlflow server --gunicorn-opts "--timeout=120" ...
```

See the [uvicorn settings documentation](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/) for more configuration options.
