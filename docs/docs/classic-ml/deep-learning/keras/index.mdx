# MLflow Keras 3.0 Integration

**Keras 3.0** represents a revolutionary leap in deep learning accessibility and flexibility. As a high-level neural networks API, Keras empowers everyone from machine learning beginners to seasoned researchers to build, train, and deploy sophisticated models with unprecedented ease.

What makes Keras 3.0 truly special is its **multi-backend architecture**. Unlike previous versions, Keras 3.0 can seamlessly run on top of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch - giving you the freedom to choose the best backend for your specific use case without changing your code.

<details>
  <summary>Why Keras 3.0 is a Game Changer</summary>

  - ⚡ **JAX**: High-performance computing with automatic differentiation and JIT compilation
  - 🔬 **PyTorch**: Research-friendly interface with dynamic computation graphs
  - 🔄 **Seamless Switching**: Change backends without rewriting your model code

  #### Universal Design Philosophy
  - 🎯 **Beginner-Friendly**: Simple, intuitive APIs that make deep learning accessible
  - 🚀 **Research-Ready**: Advanced features for cutting-edge experimentation
  - 🏗️ **Production-Proven**: Battle-tested in enterprise environments worldwide
  - 📚 **Comprehensive**: From basic neural networks to complex architectures

</details>

## Why MLflow + Keras 3.0?

The combination of MLflow's experiment tracking capabilities with Keras 3.0's flexibility creates a powerful synergy for deep learning practitioners:

- 📊 **One-Line Setup**: Enable comprehensive experiment tracking with just `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()` - no configuration required
- 🔄 **Multi-Backend Consistency**: Track experiments consistently across TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch backends
- ⚙️ **Zero-Code Integration**: Your existing Keras training code works unchanged - autologging captures everything automatically
- 🛠️ **Advanced Customization**: When you need more control, use the <APILink fn="mlflow.keras.callback.MlflowCallback" /> API for specialized logging requirements
- 🔬 **Complete Reproducibility**: Every parameter, metric, and artifact is captured automatically for perfect experiment reproduction
- 👥 **Effortless Collaboration**: Share comprehensive experiment results through MLflow's intuitive UI without any manual logging

## Key Features

### One-Line Autologging Magic

The easiest way to get started with MLflow and Keras is through **autologging** - just add one line of code and MLflow automatically captures everything you need:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()  # That's it! 🎉

# Your existing Keras code works unchanged
model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=10)
```

<details>
  <summary>What Gets Automatically Logged</summary>

  #### Metrics
  - 📊 **Training & Validation Loss**: Automatic tracking of loss functions across epochs
  - 🎯 **Custom Metrics**: Any metrics you specify (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) are logged automatically
  - 🛑 **Early Stopping Metrics**: When using `EarlyStopping`, MLflow logs `stopped_epoch`, `restored_epoch`, and restoration details

  #### Parameters
  - ⚙️ **Training Configuration**: All `fit()` parameters including batch size, epochs, and validation split
  - 🧠 **Optimizer Details**: Optimizer name, learning rate, epsilon, and other hyperparameters
  - 🛑 **Callback Parameters**: Early stopping settings like `min_delta`, `patience`, and `restore_best_weights`

  #### Artifacts
  - 📋 **Model Summary**: Complete architecture overview logged at training start
  - 🤖 **MLflow Model**: Full Keras model saved for easy deployment and inference
  - 📊 **TensorBoard Logs**: Complete training history for detailed visualization

  #### Smart Run Management
  - 🚀 **Automatic Run Creation**: If no run exists, MLflow creates one automatically
  - 🔄 **Flexible Run Handling**: Works with existing runs or creates new ones as needed
  - ⏹️ **Intelligent Run Ending**: Automatically closes runs when training completes

</details>

### Advanced Logging with MlflowCallback

For users who need more control, MLflow's Keras integration also provides the powerful `MlflowCallback` that offers fine-grained customization:

<details>
  <summary>Advanced Callback Capabilities</summary>

  - 📋 **Custom Parameter Logging**: Selectively log specific parameters and hyperparameters
  - 📈 **Granular Metrics Tracking**: Log metrics at custom intervals (per batch, per epoch, or custom frequencies)
  - ⏱️ **Flexible Logging Frequency**: Choose between epoch-based or batch-based logging to match your monitoring needs
  - 🎛️ **Custom Callback Extensions**: Subclass the callback to implement specialized logging for your unique requirements
  - 🏷️ **Advanced Artifact Management**: Control exactly which artifacts get saved and when
  - 🔍 **Performance Monitoring**: Add custom tracking for training time, memory usage, and convergence patterns

</details>

### Multi-Backend Support

Run the same MLflow tracking code across different Keras backends:

```python
# Switch backends without changing your MLflow code
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "tensorflow"  # or "jax" or "torch"
```

### Advanced Experiment Management
