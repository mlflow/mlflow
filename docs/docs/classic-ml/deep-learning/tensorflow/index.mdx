## Why MLflow + TensorFlow?

The integration of MLflow with TensorFlow creates a powerful workflow for machine learning practitioners:

- 📊 **Effortless Tracking**: Enable comprehensive experiment tracking with just `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()` - no configuration required
- ⚙️ **Zero-Code Integration**: Your existing TensorFlow training code works unchanged - autologging captures everything automatically

- 👥 **Streamlined Collaboration**: Share comprehensive experiment results through MLflow's intuitive UI without any manual logging
- 🏭 **Simplified Deployment**: Deploy TensorFlow models with simple API calls across a variety of production environments

## Key Features

### One-Line Autologging

The simplest way to get started with MLflow and TensorFlow is through **autologging** - just add one line of code and MLflow automatically captures everything you need:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()  # That's it! 🎉

# Your existing TensorFlow code works unchanged
model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=10)
```

<details>
  <summary>What Gets Automatically Logged</summary>

#### Metrics

- 📈 **Training & Validation Loss**: Automatic tracking of loss functions across epochs
- 🎯 **Custom Metrics**: Any metrics you specify (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) are logged automatically
- 🛑 **Early Stopping Metrics**: When using `EarlyStopping`, MLflow logs `stopped_epoch`, `restored_epoch`, and restoration details

#### Parameters

- ⚙️ **Training Configuration**: All `fit()` parameters including batch size, epochs, and validation split
- 🧠 **Optimizer Details**: Optimizer name, learning rate, momentum, and other hyperparameters
- 🔄 **Callback Parameters**: Early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and other callback configurations

#### Artifacts

- 📋 **Model Summary**: Complete architecture overview logged at training start
- 🤖 **MLflow Model**: Full TensorFlow model saved for easy deployment and inference
- 📊 **TensorBoard Logs**: Complete training history for detailed visualization
- 📱 **SavedModel Format**: Export-ready model for deployment across environments

#### Smart Run Management

- 🚀 **Automatic Run Creation**: If no run exists, MLflow creates one automatically
- 🔄 **Flexible Run Handling**: Works with existing runs or creates new ones as needed
- ⏹️ **Intelligent Run Ending**: Automatically closes runs when training completes

### Advanced Logging with MLflow Keras Callback

For users who need more control, MLflow's TensorFlow integration also provides the powerful `MlflowCallback` that offers fine-grained customization:

<details>
  <summary>Advanced Callback Capabilities</summary>

- 📋 **Custom Parameter Logging**: Selectively log specific parameters and hyperparameters
- 📈 **Granular Metrics Tracking**: Log metrics at custom intervals (per batch, per epoch, or custom frequencies)
- ⏱️ **Flexible Logging Frequency**: Choose between epoch-based or batch-based logging to match your monitoring needs
- 🎛️ **Custom Callback Extensions**: Subclass the callback to implement specialized logging for your unique requirements
- 🏷️ **Advanced Artifact Management**: Control exactly which artifacts get saved and when
- 🔍 **Performance Monitoring**: Add custom tracking for training time, memory usage, and convergence patterns

</details>

### Comprehensive Model Management

```python
# Log your TensorFlow model with MLflow
model_info = mlflow.tensorflow.log_model(model, name="tensorflow_model")

# Later, load your model for inference
loaded_model = mlflow.tensorflow.load_model(
    model_info.model_uri
)  # The 'model_uri' attribute is in the format 'models:/<model_id>'
predictions = loaded_model.predict(test_data)
```
