# Model Registry Quickstart

Transform your model development from chaotic experimentation to organized, production-ready deployment. The MLflow Model Registry is your central hub for managing the entire model lifecycle—from initial training to production serving and beyond.

## Why the Model Registry Matters

Moving from Jupyter notebooks to production involves critical challenges that the Model Registry solves:

- 🔍 **"Which model should we deploy?"** - Compare performance across versions instantly
- 🚀 **"Is this model ready for production?"** - Clear staging and approval workflows
- 🔄 **"How do we roll back safely?"** - Version control with instant rollback capability
- 👥 **"Who approved this model?"** - Complete audit trail and collaboration features
- 📊 **"What changed between versions?"** - Detailed lineage and comparison tools

## What You'll Learn

This quickstart gets you productive with the Model Registry in **15 minutes**:

### **Step 1: Register Your First Model** (5 minutes)

## Core Model Registry Components

**🏪 Centralized Model Store**
A single, organized location for all your MLflow models. No more hunting through folders or wondering which model file is the latest version.

**🔧 Comprehensive APIs**
Programmatically create, read, update, and delete models. Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows.

**🖥️ Intuitive Web Interface**
Visually manage your model catalog, compare versions, and collaborate with team members through an elegant GUI.

## Advanced Model Management Features

**📈 Model Versioning**
Every model iteration is automatically versioned and tracked. Compare performance metrics, rollback to previous versions, and maintain complete development history.

**🏷️ Smart Aliasing**
Assign meaningful names like "production", "staging", or "candidate" to specific model versions. Organize your deployment pipeline by alias instead of cryptic version numbers.

**📝 Rich Annotations**
Document your models with descriptions, performance notes, and preparation instructions. Keep institutional knowledge with the models themselves.

**🔖 Flexible Tagging**
Organize models with custom key-value tags. Filter by team, use case, performance tier, or any criteria that matters to your organization.

## Real-World Impact

Organizations using MLflow Model Registry report:

- **75% faster model preparation cycles** through streamlined staging workflows
- **90% reduction in deployment errors** via systematic versioning and stage management
- **Complete model lineage tracking** from training experiments to production readiness
- **Seamless team collaboration** with shared model catalogs and stage-based approval processes

## Perfect for Your Use Case

**🔬 Data Scientists**: Focus on model development while maintaining organized experiment results and smooth handoffs to engineering teams through proper staging.

**🛠️ ML Engineers**: Prepare models for deployment with confidence using version control, staging environments, and systematic model progression workflows.

**👨‍💼 ML Managers**: Gain visibility into model performance, deployment status, and team productivity across all projects.

**🏢 Enterprise Teams**: Implement governance, compliance, and audit trails while maintaining development velocity.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic MLflow knowledge** (completed the [First Model Tutorial](/ml/getting-started/logging-first-model/) is ideal)
- **Python environment** with MLflow installed
- **15 minutes** for hands-on learning

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

✅ **Registered a model** programmatically during training
✅ **Explored the Registry UI** to understand model management capabilities
✅ **Applied model aliases and stages** to organize models across development lifecycle
✅ **Loaded models by alias** for consistent, deployment-ready workflows
