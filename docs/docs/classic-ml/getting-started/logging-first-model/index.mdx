# Your First MLflow Model: Complete Tutorial

Master the fundamentals of MLflow by building your first end-to-end machine learning workflow. This hands-on tutorial takes you from setup to deployment, covering all the essential MLflow concepts you need to succeed.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a complete ML pipeline that:

- 🎯 **Predicts apple quality** using a synthetic dataset you'll generate
- 📊 **Tracks experiments** with parameters, metrics, and model artifacts
- 🔍 **Compares model performance** using the MLflow UI
- 📦 **Registers your best model** for production use
- 🚀 **Deploys a working API** for real-time predictions

:::info Perfect for Beginners
🎓 No prior MLflow experience required. We'll guide you through every concept with clear explanations and practical examples.

⏱️ Complete the full tutorial at your own pace in 30-45 minutes, with each step building naturally on the previous one.

## Learning Path

This tutorial is designed as a progressive learning experience:

### **Phase 1: Setup & Foundations** (10 minutes)
- [🖥️ Start Your MLflow Tracking Server](/ml/getting-started/logging-first-model/step1-tracking-server) - Get your local environment running
- [🔌 Master the MLflow Client API](/ml/getting-started/logging-first-model/step2-mlflow-client) - Learn the programmatic interface
- [📁 Understand MLflow Experiments](/ml/getting-started/logging-first-model/step3-create-experiment) - Organize your ML work

### **Phase 2: Data & Experimentation** (15 minutes)
- [🔍 Search and Filter Experiments](/ml/getting-started/logging-first-model/step4-experiment-search) - Navigate your work efficiently
- [🍎 Generate Your Apple Dataset](/ml/getting-started/logging-first-model/step5-synthetic-data) - Create realistic training data
- [📈 Log Your First ML Runs](/ml/getting-started/logging-first-model/step6-logging-a-run) - Track parameters, metrics, and models

## What Makes This Tutorial Special

### **Real-World Focused**
Instead of toy examples, you'll work with a realistic apple quality prediction problem that demonstrates practical ML workflows.

### **Hands-On Learning**
Every concept is immediately applied through code examples that you can run and modify.

### **Complete Workflow**
Experience the full ML lifecycle from data creation to model deployment, not just isolated features.

### **Visual Learning**
Extensive use of the MLflow UI helps you understand how tracking data appears in practice.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **Basic Python knowledge** (variables, functions, loops)
- **10 minutes** for initial setup

No machine learning expertise required - we'll explain the ML concepts as we go!

## Two Ways to Follow Along

### **Interactive Web Tutorial** (Recommended)
Follow the step-by-step guide in your browser with detailed explanations and screenshots. Perfect for understanding concepts deeply.
