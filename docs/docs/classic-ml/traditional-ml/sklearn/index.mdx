# MLflow Scikit-learn Integration

## Introduction

Scikit-learn is a comprehensive machine learning library for Python, providing tools for classification, regression, clustering, and preprocessing. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, scikit-learn offers a consistent API across all estimators with unified `fit()`, `predict()`, and `transform()` methods.

MLflow's integration with scikit-learn provides automatic experiment tracking, model management, and deployment capabilities for traditional machine learning workflows.

## Key Features

  }
]} />

## What Gets Logged

When autologging is enabled, MLflow automatically captures:

- **Parameters**: All model parameters from `estimator.get_params(deep=True)`
- **Metrics**: Training scores, classification/regression metrics, cross-validation results
- **Models**: Serialized models with signatures and input examples
- **Artifacts**: Cross-validation results, metric information, model metadata

For GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, MLflow creates child runs for parameter combinations and logs the best estimator separately.
