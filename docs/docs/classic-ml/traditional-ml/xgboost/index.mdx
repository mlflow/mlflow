### Effortless Autologging

MLflow's XGBoost integration offers the most comprehensive autologging experience for gradient boosting:

```python
import mlflow
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Enable complete experiment tracking with one line
mlflow.xgboost.autolog()

# Load data
data = load_breast_cancer()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Your existing XGBoost code works unchanged
dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, label=y_train)
dtest = xgb.DMatrix(X_test, label=y_test)

params = {
    "objective": "binary:logistic",
    "max_depth": 6,
    "learning_rate": 0.1,
    "subsample": 0.8,
    "colsample_bytree": 0.8,
}

# Train model - everything is automatically logged
model = xgb.train(
    params=params,
    dtrain=dtrain,
    num_boost_round=100,
    evals=[(dtrain, "train"), (dtest, "eval")],
    early_stopping_rounds=10,
