# MLflow XGBoost Integration

## Introduction

**XGBoost** (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular gradient boosting library for structured data. MLflow provides native integration with XGBoost for experiment tracking, model management, and deployment.

This integration supports both the native XGBoost API and scikit-learn compatible interface, making it easy to track experiments and deploy models regardless of which API you prefer.

## Key Features

<FeatureHighlights features={[
  {
    icon: Zap,
    title: "Automatic Logging",
    description: "Single line of code (mlflow.xgboost.autolog()) captures all parameters, metrics per boosting round, and feature importance without manual instrumentation."
  },
  {
    icon: Package,
    title: "Complete Model Recording",
    description: "Logs trained models with serialization format, input/output signatures, model dependencies, and Python environment for reproducible deployments."
  },
  {
    icon: TrendingUp,
    title: "Hyperparameter Tuning",
    description: "Automatically creates child runs for GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, tracking all parameter combinations and their performance metrics."
  },
  {
    icon: GitBranch,
    title: "Dual API Support",
    description: "Works with both native XGBoost API (xgb.train) and scikit-learn compatible estimators (XGBClassifier, XGBRegressor) with the same autologging functionality."
  }
]} />

## What Gets Logged

When autologging is enabled, MLflow automatically captures:

- **Parameters**: All booster parameters and training configuration
- **Metrics**: Training and validation metrics for each boosting round
- **Feature Importance**: Multiple importance types (weight, gain, cover) with visualizations
- **Model**: The trained model with proper serialization format
- **Artifacts**: Feature importance plots and JSON data
