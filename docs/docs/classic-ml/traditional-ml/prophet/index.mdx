# MLflow Prophet Integration

## Introduction

**Prophet** is Facebook's revolutionary time series forecasting library that democratizes high-quality forecasting for everyone. Built with simplicity and robustness in mind, Prophet enables analysts and data scientists to create accurate forecasts without deep expertise in time series methods, making sophisticated forecasting accessible to business users and technical teams alike.

Prophet's strength lies in its intuitive approach to complex time series patterns. By decomposing time series into trend, seasonality, and holiday effects, Prophet handles the messy realities of business data – missing values, outliers, and irregular patterns – while producing forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable.

## Key Features

### Simple Model Logging

MLflow's Prophet integration makes time series forecasting experiments effortless:

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.prophet
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
from prophet.diagnostics import cross_validation, performance_metrics

# Load your time series data
df = pd.read_csv("your_timeseries_data.csv")

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Create and fit Prophet model
    model = Prophet(
        changepoint_prior_scale=0.05,
        seasonality_prior_scale=10,
        holidays_prior_scale=10,
        yearly_seasonality=True,
        weekly_seasonality=True,
        daily_seasonality=False,
    )

    model.fit(df)

    # Log model parameters automatically
    mlflow.log_params(
        {
            "changepoint_prior_scale": 0.05,
            "seasonality_prior_scale": 10,
            "holidays_prior_scale": 10,
        }
    )

    # Cross-validation and metrics
    cv_results = cross_validation(
        model, initial="730 days", period="180 days", horizon="365 days"
    )

    metrics = performance_metrics(cv_results)
    avg_metrics = metrics[["mse", "rmse", "mae", "mape"]].mean().to_dict()
    mlflow.log_metrics(avg_metrics)

    # Log the model
    mlflow.prophet.log_model(
        pr_model=model, name="prophet_model", input_example=df[["ds"]].head()
    )
```

### High-Volume Training Optimization

For large-scale Prophet deployments with hundreds or thousands of models, some points will need to be considered to prevent creating instability with your Tracking Server.

:::tip
Bulk Logging for Performance

  When training many Prophet models (e.g., individual forecasts for thousands of products or locations), avoid overwhelming the MLflow tracking server by using bulk logging approaches:

  - 🚀 **In-Memory Aggregation**: Store metrics and parameters in lists/dictionaries during training
  - 📦 **Batch API Calls**: Use MLflow's bulk logging APIs (`log_metrics()`, `log_params()`) with dictionaries to reduce network overhead
  - ⚡ **Reduced I/O**: Minimize tracking server requests by batching logging operations
  - 🎯 **Selective Logging**: Log only essential metrics and parameters for large-scale experiments
