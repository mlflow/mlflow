# Version Tracking


## <span style={{color: "red"}}>TODO</span>

talk about 

- you have 3 options 
     - log the entire model's code as a deployable artifact (primarily for dbx, not reccomended elsehwere)
     - manually log metadata about the version 
        - prompts, params, etc
        - talk about how you call `trace(model_id=...)`
     - leverage auto tracking for git-based repos 

- git based tracking 
    - we pick up the commit hash (or a dirty tag)
    - we pick up any prompt versions!
    - in production you need to set an ENV var or call an api to register the version 
    - can you create a version manualy??
    - talk about how it shows up the in UC 
        - will it??

- why do you do this?
    - compare performance over time 
    - more easily a/b test 
    - track evals to a specific code / prompt version
