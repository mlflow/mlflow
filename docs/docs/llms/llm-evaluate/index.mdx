# MLflow LLM Evaluation

With the emerging of ChatGPT, LLMs have shown its power of text generation in various fields, such as
question answering, translating and text summarization. Evaluating LLMs' performance is slightly different
from traditional ML models, as very often there is no single ground truth to compare against.
MLflow provides an API <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate" /> to help evaluate your LLMs.

MLflow's LLM evaluation functionality consists of 3 main components:

1. **A model to evaluate**: it can be an MLflow `pyfunc` model, a URI pointing to one registered
   MLflow model, or any python callable that represents your model, e.g, a HuggingFace text summarization pipeline.
2. **Scorers**: the metrics/scores to compute, LLM evaluate will use LLM metrics.
3. **Evaluation data**: the data your model is evaluated at, it can be a pandas Dataframe, a python list, a
   pyspark Dataframe or an <APILink fn="mlflow.data.evaluation_dataset.EvaluationDataset" /> instance.

## Quickstart

Below is a simple example that gives an quick overview of how MLflow LLM evaluation works. The example builds
a simple question-answering model by wrapping "openai/gpt-4" with custom prompt. You can paste it to
your IPython or local editor and execute it, and install missing dependencies as prompted. Running the code
requires OpenAI API key, if you don't have an OpenAI key, you can set it up by following the [OpenAI guide](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

```python
import mlflow
import openai
import os
import pandas as pd
from getpass import getpass
from mlflow.genai.scorers import correctness

eval_data = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": [
            "What is MLflow?",
            "What is Spark?",
        ],
        "expectations": [
            "MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) "
            "lifecycle. It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big data and "
            "machine learning solutions. MLflow is designed to address the challenges that data "
            "scientists and machine learning engineers face when developing, training, and deploying "
            "machine learning models.",
            "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data "
            "processing and analytics. It was developed in response to limitations of the Hadoop "
            "MapReduce computing model, offering improvements in speed and ease of use. Spark "
            "provides libraries for various tasks such as data ingestion, processing, and analysis "
            "through its components like Spark SQL for structured data, Spark Streaming for "
            "real-time data processing, and MLlib for machine learning tasks",
        ],
    }
)

with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    system_prompt = "Answer the following question in two sentences"
    # Wrap "gpt-4" as an MLflow model.
    logged_model_info = mlflow.openai.log_model(
        model="gpt-4",
        task=openai.chat.completions,
        artifact_path="model",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": "{question}"},
        ],
    )

    # Use predefined question-answering metrics to evaluate our model.
    results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
        predict_fn=mlflow.genai.to_predict_fn(logged_model_info.model_uri),
        data=eval_data,
        scorers=[correctness()],
    )
    print(f"See aggregated evaluation results below: \n{results.metrics}")

    # Evaluation result for each data record is available in `results.tables`.
    eval_table = results.result_df
    print(f"See evaluation table below: \n{eval_table}")
```

## LLM Evaluation Scorers

There are two types of LLM evaluation metrics in MLflow:

1. **Heuristic-based scorers**: These metrics calculate a score for each data record (row in terms of Pandas/Spark dataframe), based on certain functions, such as: Rouge (<APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.rougeL" />), Flesch Kincaid (<APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.flesch_kincaid_grade_level" />) or Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) (<APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.bleu" />). These metrics are similar to traditional continuous value metrics. For the list of built-in heuristic metrics and how to define a custom metric with your own function definition, see the [Heuristic-based Metrics](#heuristic-based-metrics) section.

2. **LLM-as-a-Judge scorers**: LLM-as-a-Judge is a new type of metric that uses LLMs to score the quality of model outputs. It overcomes the limitations of heuristic-based metrics, which often miss nuances like context and semantic accuracy. LLM-as-a-Judge metrics provides a more human-like evaluation for complex language tasks while being more scalable and cost-effective than human evaluation. MLflow provides various built-in LLM-as-a-Judge metrics and supports creating custom metrics with your own prompt, grading criteria, and reference examples. See the [LLM-as-a-Judge Metrics](#llm-as-a-judge-metrics) section for more details.


#### Use a Custom List of Scorers {#llm-eval-custom-scorers}

You can also specify custom list of scorers in the `scorers` argument in `mlflow.genai.evaluate`:

- To add custom scorers for evaluation decorate your scorer as follows:

  ```python
  from mlflow.genai.scorers import scorer


  @scorer(name="my_scorer")
  def my_scorer(inputs, outputs, expectations, trace):
      # implement custom scoring logic
      return "good"


  results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
      predict_fn=model,
      data=eval_data,
      scorers=[my_scorer],
  )
  ```

  The above code will evaluate your model using your custom defined scorer.

#### Built-in LLM-as-a-Judge scorers

To use built-in LLM-as-a-Judge scorers in MLflow, pass the list of scorer definitions to the `scorers` argument in the <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate" /> function.

The following example uses the built-in answer correctness scorer for evaluation, in addition to the latency scorer (heuristic):

```python
from mlflow.metrics import latency
from mlflow.genai.scorers import correctness

results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
    eval_data,
    scorers=[
        correctness(),
        latency(),
    ],
)
```

Here is the list of built-in LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Click on the link to see the full documentation for each metric:

- <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity" />: Evaluate how similar
  a model's generated output is compared to the information in the ground truth
  data.
- <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_correctness" />: Evaluate how
  factually correct a model's generated output is based on the information
  within the ground truth data.
- <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_relevance" />: Evaluate how relevant
  the model generated output is to the input (context is ignored).
- <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.relevance" />: Evaluate how relevant the
  model generated output is with respect to both the input and the context.
- <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.faithfulness" />: Evaluate how faithful the
  model generated output is based on the context provided.

#### Selecting the Judge Model

By default, MLflow will use OpenAI's GPT-4 model as the judge model that scores metrics. You can change the judge model by passing an override to the `model` argument within the metric definition.

##### 1. SaaS LLM Providers

To use SaaS LLM providers, such as OpenAI or Anthropic, set the `model` parameter in the metrics definition, in the format of `<provider>:/<model-name>`. Currently, MLflow supports `["openai", "anthropic", "bedrock", "mistral", "togetherai"]` as viable LLM providers for any judge model.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="OpenAI / Azure OpenAI" value="openai" default>
        OpenAI models can be accessed via the `openai:/<model-name>` URI.

        ```python
        import mlflow
        import os

        os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<your-openai-api-key>"

        answer_correctness = mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_correctness(model="openai:/gpt-4o")

        # Test the metric definition
        answer_correctness(
            inputs="What is MLflow?",
            predictions="MLflow is an innovative full self-driving airship.",
            targets="MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end ML lifecycle.",
        )
        ```

        Azure OpenAI endpoints can be accessed via the same `openai:/<model-name>` URI, by setting the environment variables, such as `OPENAI_API_BASE`, `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, etc.

        ```python
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_TYPE"] = "azure"
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "https:/my-azure-openai-endpoint.azure.com/"
        os.environ["OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"] = "gpt-4o-mini"

    <TabItem label="Anthropic" value="anthropic">
        Anthropic models can be accessed via the `anthropic:/<model-name>` URI. Note that the `default judge parameters <#overriding-default-judge-parameters>` need to be overridden by passing the `parameters` argument to the metrics definition, since the default parameters violates the Anthropic endpoint requirement (`temperature` and `top_p` cannot be specified together).

        ```python
        import mlflow
        import os

        os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "<your-anthropic-api-key>"

:::note
Your use of a third party LLM service (e.g., OpenAI) for evaluation may be subject to and governed by the LLM service's terms of use.
:::

##### 2. Self-hosted Proxy Endpoints

If you are accessing SaaS LLM providers via a proxy endpoint (e.g., for security compliance), you can set the `proxy_url` parameter in the metrics definition. Additionally, use the `extra_headers` parameters to pass extra headers for the endpoint for authentication.

```python
answer_similarity = mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity(
    model="openai:/gpt-4o",
    proxy_url="https://my-proxy-endpoint/chat",
    extra_headers={"Group-ID": "my-group-id"},
)
```

##### 3. MLflow AI Gateway Endpoints

[MLflow AI Gateway](/llms/deployments/) is a self-hosted solution that allows you to query various LLM providers in a unified interface. To use an endpoint hosted by MLflow AI Gateway:

1. Start the MLflow AI Gateway server with your LLM setting by following [these steps](/llms/deployments/#deployments-quickstart).
2. Set the MLflow deployment client to target the server address by using :py:func:`~mlflow.deployments.set_deployments_target()`.
3. Set `endpoints:/<endpoint-name>` to the `model` parameter in the metrics definition.

```python
from mlflow.deployments import set_deployments_target

# When the MLflow AI Gateway server is running at http://localhost:5000
set_deployments_target("http://localhost:5000")
my_answer_similarity = mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity(
    model="endpoints:/my-endpoint"
)
```

##### 4. Databricks Model Serving

If you have a model hosted on Databricks, you can use it as a judge model by setting `endpoints:/<endpoint-name>` to the `model` parameter in the metrics definition. The following code uses a Llama 3.1 405B model available via the [Foundation Model API](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html).

```python
from mlflow.deployments import set_deployments_target

set_deployments_target("databricks")
llama3_answer_similarity = mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity(
    model="endpoints:/databricks-llama-3-1-405b-instruct"
)
```

#### Overriding Default Judge Parameters

By default, MLflow queries the judge LLM model with the following parameters:

```yaml
temperature: 0.0
max_tokens: 200
top_p: 1.0
```

However, this might not be suitable for all LLM providers. For example, accessing Anthropic's Claude models on Amazon Bedrock requires an `anthropic_version` parameter to be specified in the request payload. You can override these default parameters by passing the `parameters` argument to the metrics definition.

```python
my_answer_similarity = mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity(
    model="bedrock:/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
    parameters={
        "temperature": 0,
        "max_tokens": 256,
        "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
    },
)
```

Note that the parameters dictionary you pass in the `parameters` argument will **replace the default parameters**, instead of being merged with them. For example, `top_p` will **not** be sent to the model in the above code example.

#### Creating Custom LLM-as-a-Judge Metrics

You can also create your own LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation metrics with <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.make_genai_metric" /> API, which needs the following information:

- `name`: the name of your custom metric.
- `definition`: describe what's the metric doing.
- `grading_prompt`: describe the scoring criteria.
- `examples` (Optional): a few input/output examples with scores provided; used as a reference for the LLM judge.

See the <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.make_genai_metric">API documentation</APILink> for the full list of the configurations.

Under the hood, `definition`, `grading_prompt`, `examples` together with evaluation data and model output will be
composed into a long prompt and sent to LLM. If you are familiar with the concept of prompt engineering,
SaaS LLM evaluation metric is basically trying to compose a "right" prompt containing instructions, data and model
output so that LLM, e.g., GPT4 can output the information we want.

Now let's create a custom GenAI metrics called "professionalism", which measures how professional our model output is.

Let's first create a few examples with scores, these will be the reference samples LLM judge uses. To create such examples,
we will use <APILink fn="mlflow.metrics.genai.EvaluationExample" /> class, which has 4 fields:

- input: input text.
- output: output text.
- score: the score for output in the context of input.
- justification: why do we give the `score` for the data.

```python
professionalism_example_score_2 = mlflow.metrics.genai.EvaluationExample(
    input="What is MLflow?",
    output=(
        "MLflow is like your friendly neighborhood toolkit for managing your machine learning projects. It helps "
        "you track experiments, package your code and models, and collaborate with your team, making the whole ML "
        "workflow smoother. It's like your Swiss Army knife for machine learning!"
    ),
    score=2,
    justification=(
        "The response is written in a casual tone. It uses contractions, filler words such as 'like', and "
        "exclamation points, which make it sound less professional. "
    ),
)
professionalism_example_score_4 = mlflow.metrics.genai.EvaluationExample(
    input="What is MLflow?",
    output=(
        "MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It was "
        "developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big data and machine learning solutions. MLflow is "
        "designed to address the challenges that data scientists and machine learning engineers face when "
        "developing, training, and deploying machine learning models.",
    ),
    score=4,
    justification=("The response is written in a formal language and a neutral tone. "),
)
```

Now let's define the `professionalism` metric, you will see how each field is set up.

```python
professionalism = mlflow.metrics.genai.make_genai_metric(
    name="professionalism",
    definition=(
        "Professionalism refers to the use of a formal, respectful, and appropriate style of communication that is "
        "tailored to the context and audience. It often involves avoiding overly casual language, slang, or "
        "colloquialisms, and instead using clear, concise, and respectful language."
    ),
    grading_prompt=(
        "Professionalism: If the answer is written using a professional tone, below are the details for different scores: "
        "- Score 0: Language is extremely casual, informal, and may include slang or colloquialisms. Not suitable for "
        "professional contexts."
        "- Score 1: Language is casual but generally respectful and avoids strong informality or slang. Acceptable in "
        "some informal professional settings."
        "- Score 2: Language is overall formal but still have casual words/phrases. Borderline for professional contexts."
        "- Score 3: Language is balanced and avoids extreme informality or formality. Suitable for most professional contexts. "
        "- Score 4: Language is noticeably formal, respectful, and avoids casual elements. Appropriate for formal "
        "business or academic settings. "
    ),
    examples=[professionalism_example_score_2, professionalism_example_score_4],
    model="openai:/gpt-4o-mini",
    parameters={"temperature": 0.0},
    aggregations=["mean", "variance"],
    greater_is_better=True,
)
```

## Prepare Your Target Models

In order to evaluate your model with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`, your model has to be one of the following types:

1. A <APILink fn="mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel" /> instance or a URI pointing to a logged `mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel` model. In
   general we call that MLflow model. The
2. A python function that takes in string inputs and outputs a single string. Your callable must match the signature of

   <APILink fn="mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel.predict" /> (without `params` argument),
   briefly it should:

   - Has `data` as the only argument, which can be a `pandas.Dataframe`, `numpy.ndarray`, python list, dictionary or scipy matrix.
   - Returns one of `pandas.DataFrame`, `pandas.Series`, `numpy.ndarray` or list.

3. An MLflow Deployments endpoint URI pointing to a local [MLflow AI Gateway](/llms/deployments/), [Databricks Foundation Models API](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models.html), and [External Models in Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/external-models/index.html).
4. Set `model=None`, and put model outputs in `data`. Only applicable when the data is a Pandas dataframe.

### Evaluating with an MLflow Model

For detailed instruction on how to convert your model into a `mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel` instance, please read
[this doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#creating-custom-pyfunc-models). But in short,
to evaluate your model as an MLflow model, we recommend following the steps below:

1. Log your model to MLflow server by `log_model`. Each flavor (`opeanai`, `pytorch`, ...)
   has its own `log_model` API, e.g., <APILink fn="mlflow.openai.log_model" />:

   ```python
   with mlflow.start_run():
       system_prompt = "Answer the following question in two sentences"
       # Wrap "gpt-4o-mini" as an MLflow model.
       logged_model_info = mlflow.openai.log_model(
           model="gpt-4o-mini",
           task=openai.chat.completions,
           artifact_path="model",
           messages=[
               {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
               {"role": "user", "content": "{question}"},
           ],
       )
   ```

2. Use the URI of logged model as the predict_fn instance in `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`:

   ```python
   results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
       predict_fn=mlflow.genai.to_predict_fn(logged_model_info.model_uri),
       data=eval_data,
   )
   ```

### Evaluating with a Custom Function {#llm-eval-custom-function}

{/* TODO: make the mlflow.evaluate link functional */}
As of MLflow 2.8.0, <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate" /> supports evaluating a python function without requiring
logging the model to MLflow. This is useful when you don't want to log the model and just want to evaluate
it. The following example uses <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate" /> to evaluate a function. You also need to set
up OpenAI authentication to run the code below.

```python
import mlflow
import openai
import pandas as pd
from typing import List

eval_data = pd.DataFrame(
    {

### Evaluating with an MLflow Deployments Endpoint

For MLflow >= 3.0, <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate" /> supports evaluating a model endpoint by wrapping the MLflow Deployments endpoint URI to the `predict_fn` argument with <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.to_predict_fn" />.

For MLflow >= 2.11.0, <APILink fn="mlflow.evaluate" /> supports evaluating a model endpoint by directly passing the MLflow Deployments endpoint URI to the `model` argument.
This is particularly useful when you want to evaluate a deployed model hosted by a local [MLflow AI Gateway](/llms/deployments/), [Databricks Foundation Models API](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models.html), and [External Models in Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/external-models/index.html), without implementing custom prediction logic to wrap it as an MLflow model or a python function.

Please don't forget to set the target deployment client by using <APILink fn="mlflow.deployments.set_deployments_target" /> before calling <APILink fn="mlflow.evaluate" /> with the endpoint URI, as shown in the example below. Otherwise, you will see an error message like `MlflowException: No deployments target has been set...`.

:::info
When you want to use an endpoint **not** hosted by an MLflow AI Gateway or Databricks, you can create a custom Python function following the [Evaluating with a Custom Function](#llm-eval-custom-function) guide and use it as the `model` argument.

#### Supported Input Data Formats

The input data can be either of the following format when using an URI of the MLflow Deployment Endpoint as the model:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Data Format</th>
            <th>Example</th>
            <th>Additional Notes</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A pandas DataFrame with a string column.</td>
            <td  style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }}>
                ```python
                pd.DataFrame(
                    {
                        "inputs": [
                            "What is MLflow?",
                            "What is Spark?",
                        ]
                    }
                )
                ```
            </td>
            <td>For this input format, MLflow will construct the appropriate request payload to the model endpoint type. For example, if your model is a chat endpoint (`llm/v1/chat`), MLflow will wrap your input string with the chat messages format like `{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is MLflow?"}]}`. If you want to customize the request payload e.g. including system prompt, please use the next format.</td>

                    "What is Spark?",
                ]
                ```
            </td>
            <td>The <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluate" /> also accepts a list input.</td>

            </td>
            <td>Similarly to Pandas DataFrame input, the dictionary should have the correct request format for your model endpoint.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.deployments import set_deployments_target
import pandas as pd

# Point the client to Databricks Foundation Models API
set_deployments_target("databricks")

eval_data = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        # Input data must be a string column and named "inputs".
        "inputs": [
            "Write 3 reasons why you should use MLflow?",
            "Can you explain the difference between classification and regression?",
        ],
    }
)


with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
        predict_fn=mlflow.genai.to_predict_fn("endpoints:/databricks-mpt-7b-instruct"),
        data=eval_data,
    )
```

Evaluating [External Models in Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/external-models/index.html) can be done in the same way, you just need to specify the different URI that points to the serving endpoint like `"endpoints:/your-chat-endpoint"`.

## Viewing Evaluation Results

### View Evaluation Results via Code

`mlflow.genai.evaluate()` returns the evaluation results as an <APILink fn="mlflow.genai.evaluation.base.EvaluationResult" /> instance.
To see the score on selected metrics, you can check:

- `metrics`: stores the aggregated results, like average/variance across the evaluation dataset. Let's take a second
  pass on the code example above and focus on printing out the aggregated results.

{/* TODO: correctness scorer hasn't been landed */}
  ```python
  from mlflow.genai.scorers import correctness

  with mlflow.start_run() as run:
      results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
          data=eval_data,
          scorers=[correctness()],
      )
      print(f"See aggregated evaluation results below: \n{results.metrics}")
  ```

- `results.result_df`: stores the per-row evaluation results.

  ```python
  with mlflow.start_run() as run:
      results = mlflow.genai.evaluate(
          data=eval_data,
          extra_metrics=[mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity()],
      )
      print(
          f"See per-data evaluation results below: \n{results.tables['eval_results_table']}"
      )
  ```

### View Evaluation Results via the MLflow UI

Your evaluation result is automatically logged into MLflow server, so you can view your evaluation results directly from the
MLflow UI. To view the evaluation results on MLflow UI, please follow the steps below:

1. Go to the experiment view of your MLflow experiment.
2. Select the "Evaluation" tab.
3. Select the runs you want to check evaluation results.
4. Select the metrics from the dropdown menu on the right side.

Please see the screenshot below for clarity:
