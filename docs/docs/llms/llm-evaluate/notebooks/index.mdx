# LLM Evaluation Examples

The notebooks listed below contain step-by-step tutorials on how to use MLflow to evaluate LLMs. 

The first set of notebooks is centered around evaluating an LLM for question-answering with a 
prompt engineering approach. The second set is centered around evaluating a RAG system. 

All the notebooks will demonstrate how to use MLflow's builtin metrics such as token_count and 
toxicity as well as LLM-judged intelligent metrics such as answer_relevance.
