### Setup permissions for "Chat with the bot"

- For users who do not have access to the workspace, an account admin uses account-level SCIM provisioning to sync users and groups automatically from your identity provider to your :re[Databricks] account. You can also manually register these users and groups to give them access when you set up identities in Databricks. See [\_](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/users-groups/scim/index.md).
- For users who already have access to the workspace that contains the review app, no additional configuration is required.

The following code example shows how to give users permission to the model that was deployed via `agents.deploy`. The `users` parameter takes a list of email addresses.

```python
from databricks import agents

# Note that <user_list> can specify individual users or groups.
agents.set_permissions(model_name=<model_name>, users=[<user_list>], permission_level=agents.PermissionLevel.CAN_QUERY)
```

:::note

To give permissions for all users in the workspace, set `users=["users"]`.
