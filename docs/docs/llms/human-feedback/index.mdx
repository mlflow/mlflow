# Overview

MLflow's human feedback capabilities enable you to collect, manage, and leverage expert insights to improve your GenAI applications. By gathering structured feedback from domain experts and end-users, you can continuously enhance your models' quality and relevance.

## Domain Expert Feedback

Collect high-quality feedback from subject matter experts to improve your models and shape your evaluation metrics.
