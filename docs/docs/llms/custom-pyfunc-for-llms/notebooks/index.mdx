# Custom PyFuncs for Advanced LLMs with MLflow - Notebooks

If you'd like to delve deeper into the notebooks in this guide, they can be viewed or downloaded directly below.

## Deploying Advanced LLMs with Custom PyFuncs

### Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore the nuances of deploying advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with MLflow, particularly focusing on models
that can't be readily managed with MLflow's built-in functionality. We'll highlight the necessity of custom _pyfunc_ definitions when
dealing with such complex models, emphasizing its role in managing intricate model behaviors and dependencies. By the end, you'll understand
the intricacies of deploying an LLM model using the MPT-7B instruct transformer, wrapped efficiently using a custom _pyfunc_.

### What you will learn

- **LLM Deployment Challenges**: Recognize the complexities and challenges associated with deploying advanced LLMs in MLflow.
- **Custom PyFuncs for LLMs**: Understand the need and process of creating a custom _pyfunc_ to effectively manage LLMs, particularly when default flavors fall short.
- **Prompt Management in Deployment**: Delve into how custom _pyfunc_ allows manipulation of interface data to generate prompts, simplifying end-user interactions in a RESTful environment.
- **Leveraging Custom PyFunc for Enhanced Flexibility**: Witness how custom _pyfunc_ definitions provide the flexibility needed for advanced model behaviors and dependencies.

### Why Custom _pyfunc_ for LLM Deployment?

Deploying advanced LLMs isn't straightforward. Models like the MPT-7B instruct transformer have specific requirements and behaviors that don't align with traditional MLflow flavors.
This section highlights the challenges faced and the importance of custom _pyfunc_ definitions in addressing these challenges.

### Crafting the Custom _pyfunc_

Venturing into the solution, we'll craft a custom _pyfunc_ to efficiently wrap and manage our LLM. This custom definition serves as a bridge, ensuring our LLM can be deployed
seamlessly while retaining its original capabilities and adhering to MLflow's standards.

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **LLM Introduction**: Understand the MPT-7B instruct transformer, its importance, and its intricacies.
2. **Challenges with Traditional Deployment**: Recognize the difficulties when attempting to deploy such an LLM using MLflow's default capabilities.
3. **Designing the Custom _pyfunc_**: Create a custom _pyfunc_ that addresses the LLM's requirements and behaviors.
4. **Deploying the LLM**: Integrate with MLflow to deploy the LLM using the crafted custom _pyfunc_.
5. **Interface Simplification**: Examine how the custom _pyfunc_ simplifies user interactions, particularly in RESTful deployments.

### Wrap Up

With the complexities of advanced LLM deployment unraveled, this tutorial showcases the indispensable role of custom _pyfunc_ in MLflow. Through a detailed,
hands-on approach, you'll appreciate how custom _pyfunc_ definitions can make seemingly insurmountable deployment challenges manageable and streamlined.
