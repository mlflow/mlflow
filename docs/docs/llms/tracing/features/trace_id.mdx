## <span style={{color: "red"}}>TODO: add in docs about how get the trace id</span>

use Cases
1. getting the trace id to link feedback 
2. getting the trace id to attach to your request id in another system
3. (not built, but we should probably do this) providing your custom trace_id so you dont have to do (2)
4. (not built, but we must probably do this) How to get the databricks_request_id from model serving when you deploy there (ideally, we just make this the trace_id)
