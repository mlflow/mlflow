# Linking to MLflow Runs

If a trace is generated within a run context, the recorded traces to an active Experiment will be associated with the active Run.

For example, in the following code, the traces are generated within the `start_run` context.

```python
import mlflow

# Create and activate an Experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("Run Associated Tracing")

# Start a new MLflow Run
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    # Initiate a trace by starting a Span context from within the Run context
    with mlflow.start_span(name="Run Span") as parent_span:
        parent_span.set_inputs({"input": "a"})
        parent_span.set_outputs({"response": "b"})
        parent_span.set_attribute("a", "b")
        # Initiate a child span from within the parent Span's context
        with mlflow.start_span(name="Child Span") as child_span:
            child_span.set_inputs({"input": "b"})
            child_span.set_outputs({"response": "c"})
            child_span.set_attributes({"b": "c", "c": "d"})
```

When navigating to the MLflow UI and selecting the active Experiment, the trace display view will show the run that is associated with the trace, as
well as providing a link to navigate to the run within the MLflow UI. See the below video for an example of this in action.

You can also programmatically retrieve the traces associated to a particular Run by using the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_traces" /> method.

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Retrieve traces associated with a specific Run
traces = client.search_traces(run_id=run.info.run_id)

print(traces)
```
