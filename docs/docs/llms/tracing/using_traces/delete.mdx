# Delete Traces

You can delete traces based on specific criteria using the <APILink fn="mlflow.client.MlflowClient.delete_traces">`MlflowClient.delete_traces`</APILink> method. This method allows you to delete traces by **experiment ID**,
**maximum timestamp**, or **request IDs**.

:::tip
Deleting a trace is an irreversible process. Ensure that the setting provided within the `delete_traces` API meet the intended range for deletion.
:::

```python
import time

# Get the current timestamp in milliseconds
current_time = int(time.time() * 1000)

# Delete traces older than a specific timestamp
deleted_count = client.delete_traces(
    experiment_id="1", max_timestamp_millis=current_time, max_traces=10
)
```
