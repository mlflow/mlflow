# MLflow OpenAI Autologging

The OpenAI flavor for MLflow supports autologging to ensure that experimentation, testing, and validation of your ideas can be captured dynamically without
having to wrap your code with logging boilerplate.

:::warning attention
Autologging is **only supported** for versions of the OpenAI SDK that are 1.17 and higher.
:::

MLflow autologging for the OpenAI SDK supports the following interfaces:

- **Chat Completions** via `client.chat.completions.create()`
- **Completions** (legacy) via `client.completions.create()`
- **Embeddings** via `client.embeddings.create()`

Where `client` is an instance of `openai.OpenAI()`.

In this guide, we'll discuss some of the key features that are available in the autologging feature.

<TOCInline toc={toc} maxHeadingLevel={2} />

## Quickstart

To get started with MLflow's OpenAI autologging, you simply need to call <APILink fn="mlflow.openai.autolog" /> at the beginning of your script or notebook.
Enabling autologging with no argument overrides will behave as the `default` configuration in the table in the next section. Overriding any of these settings
will allow you to log additional elements.

:::tip
The only element that is **enabled by default** when autologging is activated is the recording of trace information. You can read more about MLflow tracing
[here](/tracing).
:::

```python
import os
import openai
import mlflow

# Enables trace logging by default
mlflow.openai.autolog()

openai_client = openai.OpenAI()

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What does turning something up to 11 refer to?",
    }
]

# The input messages and the response will be logged as a trace to the active experiment
answer = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.99,
)
```

:::note
When using the OpenAI SDK, ensure that your access token is assigned to the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
:::

## Configuration of OpenAI Autologging

MLflow OpenAI autologging can log various information about the model and its inference. **By default, only trace logging is enabled**, but you can enable
autologging of other information by setting the corresponding parameters when calling <APILink fn="mlflow.openai.autolog" />.

The available options and their default values are shown below. To learn more about additional parameters, see the API documentation.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Target</th>
      <th>Default</th>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Traces</td>
      <td>`true`</td>
      <td>`log_traces`</td>
      <td>Whether to generate and log traces for the model. See [MLflow Tracing](/tracing) for more details about the tracing feature.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Model Artifacts</td>
      <td>`false`</td>
      <td>`log_models`</td>
      <td>If set to `True`, the OpenAI model will be logged when it is invoked.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Model Signatures</td>
      <td>`false`</td>
      <td>`log_model_signatures`</td>
      <td>
        If set to `True`, <APILink fn="mlflow.models.ModelSignature">`ModelSignature`</APILink> describing model inputs and outputs are collected and logged along with OpenAI model artifacts during inference. This option is only available when `log_models` is enabled.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Input Example</td>
      <td>`false`</td>
      <td>`log_input_examples`</td>
      <td>If set to `True`, input examples from inference data are collected and logged along with OpenAI model artifacts during inference. This option is only available when `log_models` is enabled.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For example, to disable logging of traces, and instead enable model logging, run the following code:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.openai.autolog(
    log_traces=False,
    log_models=True,
)
```

## Example of using OpenAI Autologging

```python
import os

import mlflow
import openai

API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
EXPERIMENT_NAME = "OpenAI Autologging Demonstration"
REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME = "openai-auto"
MODEL_VERSION = 1

mlflow.openai.autolog(
    log_input_examples=True,
    log_model_signatures=True,
    log_models=True,
    log_traces=True,
    registered_model_name=REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME,
)

mlflow.set_experiment(EXPERIMENT_NAME)

openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=API_KEY)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "State that you are responding to a test and that you are alive.",
    }
]

openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.95,
)
```

Viewing the logged model and the trace used when invoking the OpenAI client within the UI can be seen in the image below:

![OpenAI Autologging artifacts and traces](/images/tutorials/llms/openai-autolog.gif)

The model can be loaded by using the `models` uri via the model that was logged and registered and interfaced with via the pyfunc API as shown below:

```python
loaded_autologged_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(
    f"models:/{REGISTERED_MODEL_NAME}/{MODEL_VERSION}"
)

loaded_autologged_model.predict(
    "How much relative time difference would occur between an astronaut travelling at 0.98c for 14 years "
    "as measured by an on-board clock on the spacecraft and humans on Earth, assuming constant speed?"
)
```

## Auto-tracing for OpenAI Swarm

MLflow 2.17.1 introduced built-in tracing capability for [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main), a multi-agent orchestration framework from OpenAI. The framework provides a clean interface to build multi-agent systems on top of the OpenAI's Function Calling capability and the concept of [handoff & routines patterns](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/orchestrating_agents).

MLflow's automatic tracing capability offers seamless tracking of interactions between agents, tool calls, and their collective outputs. You can enable auto-tracing for OpenAI Swarm just by calling the <APILink fn="mlflow.openai.autolog" /> function.

```python
import mlflow
from swarm import Swarm, Agent

# Calling the autolog API will enable trace logging by default.
mlflow.openai.autolog()

mlflow.set_experiment("OpenAI Swarm")

client = Swarm()


def transfer_to_agent_b():
    return agent_b


agent_a = Agent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    functions=[transfer_to_agent_b],
)

agent_b = Agent(
    name="Agent B",
    instructions="Only speak in Haikus.",
)

response = client.run(
    agent=agent_a,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I want to talk to agent B."}],
)
print(response)
```

The logged trace, associated with the `OpenAI Swarm` experiment, can be seen in the MLflow UI, as shown below:

## FAQ

### Are asynchronous APIs supported in autologging?

The MLflow OpenAI autologging feature **does not support asynchronous APIs** for logging models or traces.

Saving your async implementation is best done by using the [models from code feature](/model#models-from-code).

If you would like to log trace events for an async OpenAI API, below is a simplified example of logging the trace for a streaming async request:

```python
import openai
import mlflow
import asyncio

# Activate an experiment for logging traces to
mlflow.set_experiment("OpenAI")


async def fetch_openai_response(messages, model="gpt-4o", temperature=0.99):
    """
    Asynchronously gets a response from the OpenAI API using the provided messages and streams the response.

    Args:
        messages (list): List of message dictionaries for the OpenAI API.
        model (str): The model to use for the OpenAI API. Default is "gpt-4o".
        temperature (float): The temperature to use for the OpenAI API. Default is 0.99.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    client = openai.AsyncOpenAI()

    # Create the response stream
    response_stream = await client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
        stream=True,
    )

    # Manually log traces using the tracing fluent API
    with mlflow.start_span() as trace:
        trace.set_inputs(messages)
        full_response = []

        async for chunk in response_stream:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            if content is not None:
                print(content, end="")
                full_response.append(content)

        trace.set_outputs("".join(full_response))


messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "How much additional hydrogen mass would Jupiter require to ignite a sustainable fusion cycle?",
    }
]

await fetch_openai_response(messages)
```
