# Sentence Transformers within MLflow

:::warning attention
The `sentence_transformers` flavor is in active development and is marked as Experimental. Public APIs may change and new features are
subject to be added as additional functionality is brought to the flavor.
:::

The `sentence_transformers` model flavor enables logging of
[sentence-transformers models](https://www.sbert.net) in MLflow format via
the <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.save_model" /> and <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.log_model" /> functions. Using these
functions also adds the `python_function` flavor to the MLflow Models, enabling the model to be
interpreted as a generic Python function for inference via <APILink fn="mlflow.pyfunc.load_model" />.
Additionally, <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.load_model" /> can be used to load a saved or logged MLflow
Model with the `sentence_transformers` flavor in the native sentence-transformers format.

## Tutorials for Sentence Transformers

## Input and Output Types for PyFunc

The `sentence_transformers` [python_function (pyfunc) model flavor](/model#pyfunc-model-flavor) standardizes
the process of embedding sentences and computing semantic similarity. This standardization allows for serving
and batch inference by adapting the required data structures for `sentence_transformers` into formats compatible with JSON serialization and casting to Pandas DataFrames.

:::note
The `sentence_transformers` flavor supports various models for tasks such as embedding generation, semantic similarity, and paraphrase mining. The specific input and output types will depend on the model and task being performed.
:::

## Saving and Logging Sentence Transformers Models

You can save and log sentence-transformers models in MLflow. Here's an example of both saving and logging a model:

```Python
import mlflow
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("model_name")

# Saving the model
mlflow.sentence_transformers.save_model(model=model, path="path/to/save/directory")

# Logging the model
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.sentence_transformers.log_model(
        sentence_transformers_model=model, artifact_path="model_artifact_path"
    )
```

## Saving Sentence Transformers Models with an OpenAI-Compatible Inference Interface

:::note
This feature is only available in MLflow 2.11.0 and above.
:::

MLflow's `sentence_transformers` flavor allows you to pass in the `task` param with the string value `"llm/v1/embeddings"`
when saving a model with <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.save_model" /> and <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.log_model" />.

For example:

```python
import mlflow
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

mlflow.sentence_transformers.save_model(
    model=model, path="path/to/save/directory", task="llm/v1/embeddings"
)
```

When `task` is set as `"llm/v1/embeddings"`, MLflow handles the following for you:

- Setting an embeddings compatible signature for the model
- Performing data pre- and post-processing to ensure the inputs and outputs conform to
  the [Embeddings API spec](/llms/deployments/#embeddings),
  which is compatible with OpenAI's API spec.

Note that these modifications only apply when the model is loaded with <APILink fn="mlflow.pyfunc.load_model" /> (e.g. when
serving the model with the `mlflow models serve` CLI tool). If you want to load just the base pipeline, you can
always do so via <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.load_model" />.

Aside from the `sentence-transformers` flavor, the `transformers` flavor also support OpenAI-compatible inference interface (`"llm/v1/chat"` and `"llm/v1/completions"`). Refer to
[the Transformers flavor guide](/llms/transformers/tutorials/conversational/pyfunc-chat-model) for more information.

## Custom Python Function Implementation

In addition to using pre-built models, you can create custom Python functions with the _sentence_transformers_ flavor. Here's an example of a custom
implementation for comparing the similarity between text documents:

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util


class DocumentSimilarityModel(PythonModel):
    def load_context(self, context):
        """Load the model context for inference."""
        self.model = SentenceTransformer.load(context.artifacts["model_path"])

    def predict(self, context, model_input):
        """Predict method for comparing similarity between documents."""
        if isinstance(model_input, pd.DataFrame) and model_input.shape[1] == 2:
            documents = model_input.values
        else:
            raise ValueError("Input must be a DataFrame with exactly two columns.")

        # Compute embeddings for each document separately
        embeddings1 = self.model.encode(documents[:, 0], convert_to_tensor=True)
        embeddings2 = self.model.encode(documents[:, 1], convert_to_tensor=True)

        # Calculate cosine similarity
        similarity_scores = util.cos_sim(embeddings1, embeddings2)

        return pd.DataFrame(similarity_scores.numpy(), columns=["similarity_score"])


# Example model saving and loading
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
model_path = "/tmp/sentence_transformers_model"
model.save(model_path)

# Example usage
with mlflow.start_run():
    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(
        artifact_path="document_similarity_model",
        python_model=DocumentSimilarityModel(),
        artifacts={"model_path": model_path},
    )

loaded = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_info.model_uri)

# Test prediction
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "doc1": ["Sentence Transformers is a wonderful package!"],
        "doc2": ["MLflow is pretty great too!"],
    }
)

result = loaded.predict(df)
print(result)
```

Which will generate the similarity score for the documents passed, as shown below:

```bash
    similarity_score
0          0.275423
```
