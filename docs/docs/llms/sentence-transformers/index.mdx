# MLflow Sentence-Transformers Flavor

:::warning attention
The `sentence-transformers` flavor is under active development and is marked as Experimental. Public APIs are subject to change,
and new features may be added as the flavor evolves.
:::

## Introduction

**Sentence-Transformers** is a groundbreaking Python library that specializes in producing high-quality, semantically rich embeddings
for sentences and paragraphs. Developed as an extension of the well-known [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library
by ðŸ¤— Hugging Face, Sentence-Transformers is tailored for tasks requiring a deep understanding of sentence-level context. This library is
essential for NLP applications such as semantic search, text clustering, and similarity assessment.

Leveraging pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, which are fine-tuned for sentence embeddings, Sentence-Transformers simplifies the process
of generating meaningful vector representations of text. The library stands out for its simplicity, efficiency, and the quality of embeddings it produces.

The library features a number of powerful high-level utility functions for performing common follow-on tasks with sentence embeddings.
These include:

- **Semantic Textual Similarity**: Assessing the [semantic similarity](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) between two sentences.
- **Semantic Search**: [Searching](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html) for the most semantically similar sentences in a corpus for a given query.
- **Clustering**: Grouping [similar sentences](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/clustering/README.html) together.
- **Information Retrieval**: Finding the most relevant sentences for a given query via document [retrieval and ranking](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html).
- **Paraphrase Mining**: Finding text entries that have similar (or identical) [meaning](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html) in a large corpus of text.

## What makes this Library so Special?

Let's take a look at a very basic representation of how the Sentence-Transformers library works and what you can do with it!

Integrating Sentence-Transformers with MLflow, a platform dedicated to streamlining the entire machine learning lifecycle, enhances the experiment tracking and deployment
capabilities for these specialized NLP models. MLflow's support for Sentence-Transformers enables practitioners to effectively manage experiments, track different model versions,
and deploy models for various NLP tasks with ease.

Sentence-Transformers offers:

- **High-Quality Sentence Embeddings**: Efficient generation of sentence embeddings that capture the contextual and semantic nuances of language.
- **Pre-Trained Model Availability**: Access to a diverse range of pre-trained models fine-tuned for sentence embedding tasks, streamlining the process of embedding generation.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified API, making it accessible for both NLP experts and newcomers.
- **Custom Training and Fine-Tuning**: Flexibility to fine-tune models on specific datasets or train new models from scratch for tailored NLP solutions.

With MLflow's Sentence-Transformers flavor, users benefit from:

- **Streamlined Experiment Tracking**: Easily log parameters, metrics, and sentence embedding models during the training and fine-tuning process.
- **Hassle-Free Deployment**: Deploy sentence embedding models for various applications with straightforward API calls.
- **Broad Model Compatibility**: Support for a range of sentence embedding models from the Sentence-Transformers library, ensuring access to the latest in embedding technology.

Whether you're working on semantic text similarity, clustering, or information retrieval, MLflow's integration with Sentence-Transformers provides a robust and efficient
pathway for incorporating advanced sentence-level understanding into your applications.

## Features

With MLflow's Sentence-Transformers flavor, users can:

- **Save** and **log** Sentence-Transformer models within MLflow with the respective APIs: <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.save_model" /> and <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.log_model" />.
- Track detailed experiments, including **parameters**, **metrics**, and **artifacts** associated with fine tuning runs.
- [Deploy](/deployment) sentence embedding models for practical applications.
- Utilize the <APILink fn="mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel">`mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel`</APILink> flavor for generic Python function inference, enabling complex and powerful custom ML solutions.

### What can you do with Sentence Transformers and MLflow?

One of the more powerful applications that can be built with these tools is a semantic search engine. By using readily available open source
tooling, you can build a semantic search engine that can find the most semantically similar sentences in a corpus for a given query. This is
a significant improvement over traditional keyword-based search engines, which are limited in their ability to understand the context of a query.

An example high-level architecture for such an application stack is shown below:

### Deployment Made Easy

Once a model is trained, it needs to be deployed for inference. MLflow's integration with Sentence Transformers simplifies this by providing
functions such as <APILink fn="mlflow.sentence_transformers.load_model" /> and <APILink fn="mlflow.pyfunc.load_model" />, which allow for easy model serving.
