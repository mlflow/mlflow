# MLflow for GenAI

MLflow is built specifically to help developers build complex, production-grade GenAI applications that create business value by delivering **high‑quality (accurate) answers at the optimal cost and latency**.

## Key challenges

MLflow addresses the 2 inherent challenges in delivering high-quality generative AI:

  <PageCard
    headerText="Outputs are plain language 🗣️"
    
    text={[
      "LLMs speak in free‑form text, so judging accuracy is tough — there's rarely one perfect wording — so humans often need to look and decide.",
    ]}
    isBoldHeader={true}
  />
  <PageCard
    headerText="LLMs are non-deterministic 🎲"
    text={[
      "Even if you change nothing in the app, the same prompt can yield different responses — making issues hard to debug - so developers must track both accuracy and *consistency*.",
    ]}

  />

## How MLflow Helps

:::note 
See MLflow's reccomended [developer workflow](/llms/eval-workflow) to learn how to integrate these capabilities into your workflow.
:::


MLflow unites metrics that reliably measure GenAI quality with operational observability and human feedback, enabling teams to evaluate & improve GenAI quality, cost, and latency so they can deploy GenAI in production with confidence.
