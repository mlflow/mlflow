# Data Model

There are two primary entities in MLflow's GenAI data model:
1. **`Traces` (and its attached child entity `Assessments`):** A detailed record of a *every single* execution of your GenAI application and its corresponding quality and performance evaluations.
2. **`Evaluation Datasets`:** A curated collection of examples that represent both high-quality and problematic interactions with your GenAI application that are used to systematically evaluate and improve your app's performance.

## Traces

`Traces` (and their associated `Assessments`) are used to debug, evaluation, and monitor your application's quality and performance during development and production.  Every time your app is executed - during development, in production, or for evaluation - a [`Trace`](trace) is produced.    Each `Trace` contains:
- Metadata & Tags: Details about the execution environment and code version that generated the trace along with developer-defined key:value pairs 
- Spans: Step-by-step execution details (LLM calls, retrievers, tools, etc)

[`Traces`](trace) are annotated with [`Assessments`](trace/assessment) that describe their quality and operational performance (latency, cost, etc).  [`Assessments`](assessment) are produced by either:
* `Scorer`: A developer-defined function that programmatically evaluates traces using either:
  - Deterministic Logic: Rule-based evaluation using predefined criteria (e.g., response length, presence of required fields)
  - LLM Judge-based Logic: Using another LLM to evaluate the quality of responses, simulating a human generated evaluation (e.g., checking factual accuracy, tone, or adherence to guidelines)
* `Labeling Session`: Human-generated evaluations, done through the Review App's interactive interface.

## Evaluation Dataset

An Evaluation Dataset is a curated collection of examples used to evaluate a Gen AI application. Each example in a dataset represents a potentail user interaction with your application, carefully selected to represent both:

- **High-quality examples**: Demonstrating the expected behavior and performance standards
- **Problematic examples**: Cases where the application needs improvement or fixes

Each dataset record contains:
- Inputs to the GenAI application e.g., the user's request
- Expected outputs and behaviors
  - Note: These expectations are stored using the `Assessment` data model, with a record of of type `expectation`.


Datasets are linked to an MLFlow experiment and can be directly used as inputs to `mlflow.evaluate()`. They are backed by Delta tables in Unity Catalog, inheriting the permissions defined by the Delta table.
