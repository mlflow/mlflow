# Tracking app versions

MLflow offers several primitives for managing your GenAI application's lifecycle:


## Versions

TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS THE GENAI EQUIV TO "LOGGED MODEL"

A version represents a specific state of your application's code, similar to a Git commit. It captures:

- The exact code state at a point in time
- The configuration and dependencies used
- The environment setup

This versioning system allows you to:
- Track changes to your application over time
- Compare quality and performance assessments across different versions

Each version is uniquely identified and can be referenced when analyzing traces, making it easier to understand how changes in your code affect your application's behavior.

### Automatic Version Capture

If you are using Git, a version of your application is automatically captured every time your application is run. This process is seamless and requires no additional configuration:

- Each version is automatically linked to the current Git commit hash
- The system captures the full state of your codebase at runtime
- All dependencies and their versions are recorded
- Environment variables and configuration settings are preserved

If you use MLflow's `Prompt` and/or `ModelConfig` primitives, the properties of each primitive (e.g., prompt templates, variables, etc) are attached as metadata to the logged Version.

When deploying to your production environment, PUT IN INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT HOW TO SET THE GIT COMMIT SHA IN AN ENV VAR.

### Manual version captured

## Prompt Registry

PLACEHOLDER TEXT ABOUT THIS!!

The Prompt Registry is MLflow's solution for managing prompts in GenAI applications. It provides:

- **Version Control**: Track prompt changes with Git-inspired versioning
- **Aliasing**: Use aliases (e.g., `production`, `staging`) to manage different environments
- **Centralized Management**: Store and reuse prompts across your organization
- **Integration**: Works with MLflow's model tracking and evaluation features

When you use prompts in your application, they are automatically attached as metadata to your logged versions. This means:

- Every time you run your application, the exact prompt version used is captured
- You can track how different prompt versions affect your application's performance
- The prompt history is preserved alongside your application's version history
- You can easily roll back to previous prompt versions if needed

This tight integration between prompts and versions helps you maintain a complete record of your GenAI application's evolution, including both code and prompt changes.

## Model config 


TODO: insert discussion about how to use model config.  I'm not entirely sure how this will work, but having this (alongisde prompt registry) allows us to create a UI-based experimentation workflow that we are starting to hear in the user studies.  Not for DAIS but I want to be set up for moving here quickly.
