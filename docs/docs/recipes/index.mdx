# MLflow Recipes

:::warning
MLflow Recipes is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
:::

MLflow Recipes (previously known as MLflow Pipelines) is a framework that enables data scientists
to quickly develop high-quality models and deploy them to production.
Compared to ad-hoc ML workflows, MLflow Recipes offers several major benefits:

- **Get started quickly**: [Predefined templates](#recipe-templates) for common ML tasks,
  such as [regression modeling](#regression-template), enable data scientists to get started
  quickly and focus on building great models, eliminating the large amount of boilerplate code that
  is traditionally required to curate datasets, engineer features, train & tune models, and package
  models for production deployment.

- **Iterate faster**: The intelligent recipe execution engine accelerates model development by
  caching results from each step of the process and re-running the minimal set of steps as changes
  are made.

- **Easily ship to production**: The modular, git-integrated [recipe structure](#recipe-templates-key-concept) dramatically simplifies the handoff from development to
  production by ensuring that all model code, data, and configurations are easily reviewable and
  deployable by ML engineers.

## Quickstarts

### Prerequisites

<Link id="recipes-installation" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

MLflow Recipes is available as an extension of the
[MLflow Python library](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/). You can install MLflow Recipes
as follows:

- **Local**: Install MLflow from PyPI: `pip install mlflow`.
  Note that MLflow Recipes requires [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make),
  which may not be preinstalled on some Windows systems.
  Windows users must install Make before using MLflow Recipes. For more information about
  installing Make on Windows, see https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/install.html.

- **Databricks**: Install MLflow Recipes from a Databricks Notebook by running
  `%pip install mlflow`, or install MLflow Recipes on a Databricks Cluster by
  following the PyPI library installation instructions [here](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/cluster-libraries.html#install-a-library-on-a-cluster)
  and specifying the `mlflow` package string.

  :::note
  [Databricks Runtime](https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/dbr.html) version 11.0
  or greater is required in order to install MLflow Recipes on Databricks.
  :::

### NYC taxi fare prediction example

The [NYC taxi fare prediction example](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-examples/tree/main/regression)
uses the [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) to develop and score models on the
[NYC Taxi (TLC) Trip Record Dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
You can run the example locally by [installing MLflow Recipes](#recipes-installation) and running the
[Jupyter example regression notebook](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-examples/blob/main/regression/notebooks/jupyter.ipynb).
You can run the example on Databricks by

## Key concepts

<Link id="steps-key-concept" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

- **Steps**: A Step represents an individual ML operation, such as ingesting data,
  fitting an estimator, evaluating a model against test data, or deploying a model
  for real-time scoring. Each Step accepts a collection of well-defined inputs and
  produce well-defined outputs according to user-defined configurations and code.

<Link id="recipes-key-concept" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

- **Recipes**: A Recipe is an ordered composition of [Steps](#steps-key-concept)
  used to solve an ML problem or perform an MLOps task, such as developing a
  regression model or performing batch model scoring on production data.
  MLflow Recipes provides <APILink fn="mlflow.recipes.Recipe">API</APILink>
  and a <Link to="/api_reference/cli.html" target="_blank">CLI</Link> for running recipes and inspecting their results.

<Link id="recipe-templates-key-concept" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

- **Templates**: A Recipe Template is a git repository with a [standardized, modular layout](#recipe-template-structure)
  containing all of the customizable code and configurations for a [Recipe](#recipes-key-concept).
  Configurations are defined in YAML format for easy review via the
  [recipe.yaml](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/recipe.yaml) file and
  [Profile YAML files](#profiles-key-concept). Each template also defines its requirements, data science notebooks, and tests. MLflow Recipes
  includes [predefined templates](#recipe-templates) for a variety of model development and
  MLOps tasks.

<Link id="profiles-key-concept" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

- **Profiles**: Profiles contain user-specific or environment-specific configurations for a
  [Recipe](#recipes-key-concept), such as the particular set of hyperparameters being
  tuned by a data scientist in development or the MLflow Model Registry URI and credentials
  used to store production-worthy models. Each profile is represented as a YAML file
  in the [Recipe Template](#recipe-templates-key-concept) (e.g.
  [local.yaml](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-examples/blob/main/regression/profiles/local.yaml)
  and [databricks.yaml](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-examples/blob/main/regression/profiles/databricks.yaml)).

<Link id="step-cards-key-concept" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

- **Step Cards**: Step Cards display the results produced by running a
  [Step](#steps-key-concept), including dataset profiles, model performance & explainability
  plots, overviews of the best model parameters found during tuning, and more. Step Cards and their
  corresponding dataset and model information are also logged to MLflow Tracking.

## Usage

### Model development workflow

The general model development workflow for using MLflow Recipes is as follows:

1.  Clone a [Recipe Template](#recipe-templates) git repository corresponding to the ML
    problem that you wish to solve. Follow the template's README file for template-specific
    instructions.

    - [Local] Clone the [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) into a local directory.

      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template
      ```

    - [Databricks] Clone the [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) git repository using
      [Databricks Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html).

      <div style={{ width: "60% " }}>![](/images/recipes_databricks_repo_ui.png)</div>

2.  Edit required fields marked by `FIXME::REQUIRED` comments in `recipe.yaml` and
    `profiles/*.yaml`. The recipe is runnable once all required fields are filled with
    proper values. You may proceed to step 3 if this is the first time going through this step.
    Otherwise, continue to edit the YAML config files as well as `steps/*.py` files,
    filling out areas marked by `FIXME::OPTIONAL` as you see fit to
    customize the recipe steps to your ML problem for better model performance.

    <div style={{ width: "60%" }}>![](/images/recipes_databricks_fixme.png)</div>

3.  Run the recipe by selecting a desired profile. Profiles are used to quickly switch environment
    specific recipe settings, such as ingest data location.
    When a recipe run completes, you may inspect the run results. MLflow Recipes
    creates and displays an interactive **Step Card** with the results of the last executed [step](#steps-key-concept).
    Each [Recipe Template](#recipe-templates) also includes a
    [Databricks Notebook](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/notebooks/databricks.py)
    and a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/notebooks/jupyter.ipynb)
    for running the recipe and inspecting its results.

            Example API and CLI workflows for running the [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) and inspecting
            results. Note that recipes must be run from within their corresponding git repositories.

        :::note
        Data profiling is often best viewed with "quantiles" mode. To switch it on, on the Facet
        data profile, find `Chart to show`, click the selector below, and choose `Quantiles`.
        :::

4.  Iterate over step 2 and 3: make changes to an individual step, and test them by running
    the step and observing the results it produces.
    Use `Recipe.inspect()` to visualize the overall Recipe dependency graph and artifacts
    each step produces.
    Use `Recipe.get_artifact()` to further inspect individual step outputs in a notebook.

    MLflow Recipes intelligently caches results from each [Recipe Step](#steps-key-concept),
    ensuring that steps are only executed if their inputs, code, or configurations have changed,
    or if such changes have occurred in dependent steps. Once you are satisfied with the results of
    your changes, commit them to a branch of the [Recipe Repository](#recipe-templates-key-concept)
    in order to ensure reproducibility, and share or review the
    changes with your team.

    </figure>

    :::note
    Before testing changes in a staging or production environment, it is recommended that you
    commit the changes to a branch of the [Recipe Repository](#recipe-templates-key-concept)
    to ensure reproducibility.
    :::

    :::note
    By default, MLflow Recipes caches results from each [Recipe Step](#steps-key-concept)
    within the `.mlflow` subdirectory of the home folder on the local filesystem.
    The `MLFLOW_RECIPES_EXECUTION_DIRECTORY` environment variable can be used to specify
    an alternative location for caching results.
    :::

### Development environments

We recommend using one of the following environment configurations to develop models with MLflow Recipes:

<dl>
  <dt>
    #### [Databricks]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    - Edit YAML config and Python files in Databricks Repos. Open separate browser tabs for each
      file module that you wish to modify. For example,
      one for the recipe config file `recipe.yaml`,
      one for the profile config file `profile/databricks.yaml`,
      one for the driver notebook `notebooks/databricks.py`,
      and one for the current step (e.g. train) under development `steps/train.py`.
    - Use `notebooks/databricks.py` as the driver to run recipe steps and inspect its output.
    - Pin the workspace browser for easy file navigation.

    <div style={{ width: "60%"}}>
      ![](/images/recipes_databricks_ui.png)
    </div>

  </dd>
  <dt>
    #### [Local with Jupyter Notebook]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    - Use `notebooks/jupyter.ipynb` as the driver to run recipe steps and inspect its output.
    - Edit `recipe.yaml`, `steps/*.py` and `profiles/*.yaml` accordingly with an editor of your
      choice.
    - To run the entire recipe, either run `notebooks/jupyter.ipynb` or on commandline, invoke
      `mlflow recipes run --profile local` (change the current working directory to the project root first).

  </dd>
  <dt>
    #### [Edit locally with IDE (VSCode) and run on Databricks]
  </dt>
  <dd>
    - Edit files on your local machine with VSCode and Jupyter plugin.
    - Use [dbx](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/dbx.html) to sync them to
      [Databricks Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html) as demonstrated below.
    - On Databricks, use the `notebooks/databricks.py` notebook as the driver to run recipe
      steps and inspect their outputs.

    Example workflow for efficiently editing a recipe on a local machine
    and synchronizing changes to [Databricks Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html):

    ```sh
    # Install the Databricks CLI, which is used to remotely access your Databricks Workspace
    pip install databricks-cli
    # Configure remote access to your Databricks Workspace
    databricks configure
    # Install dbx, which is used to automatically sync changes to and from Databricks Repos
    pip install dbx
    # Clone the MLflow Recipes Regression Template
    git clone https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template
    # Enter the MLflow Recipes Regression Template directory and configure dbx within it
    cd recipes-regression-template
    dbx configure
    # Use dbx to enable syncing from the repository directory to Databricks Repos
    dbx sync repo -d recipes-regression-template
    # Iteratively make changes to files in the repository directory and observe that they
    # are automatically synced to Databricks Repos
    ```

  </dd>
</dl>

## Recipe Templates

MLflow Recipes currently offers the following predefined templates that can be easily customized
to develop and deploy high-quality, production-ready models for your use cases:

<Link id="regression-template" className="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" />

- **MLflow Recipes Regression Template**: The MLflow Recipes Regression Template is designed for developing and scoring
  regression models. For more information, see the [Regression Template reference guide](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/README.md).

<Link id="classification-template" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

- **MLflow Recipes Classification Template**: The MLflow Recipes Classification Template is designed for developing and scoring
  classification models. For more information, see the [Classification Template reference guide](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-classification-template/blob/main/README.md).

Additional recipes for a variety of ML problems and MLOps tasks are under active development.

## Detailed reference guide

### Template structure \{#recipe-template-structure}

Recipe Templates are git repositories with a standardized, modular layout. The following
example provides an overview of the recipe repository structure. It is adapted from the
[MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template).

```plaintext
├── recipe.yaml
├── requirements.txt
├── steps
│   ├── ingest.py
│   ├── split.py
│   ├── transform.py
│   ├── train.py
│   ├── custom_metrics.py
├── profiles
│   ├── local.yaml
│   ├── databricks.yaml
├── tests
│   ├── ingest_test.py
│   ├── ...
│   ├── train_test.py
│   ├── ...
```

The main components of the Recipe Template layout, which are common across all recipes, are:

- `recipe.yaml`: The main recipe configuration file that declaratively defines the
  attributes and behavior of each recipe step, such as the input dataset to use for training
  a model or the performance criteria for promoting a model to production. For reference,
  see the [recipe.yaml](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/recipe.yaml)
  configuration file from the [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template).

- `requirements.txt`: A [pip requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format)
  specifying packages that must be installed in order to run the recipe.

- `steps`: A directory containing Python code modules used by the recipe steps. For example,
  the [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) defines the estimator type and parameters to use
  when training a model in [steps/train.py](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/steps/train.py)
  and defines custom metric computations in
  [steps/custom_metrics.py](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/steps/custom_metrics.py).

  <Link id="profiles-directory" class="anchor-with-sticky-navbar" /> 

- `profiles`: A directory containing [Profile](#profiles-key-concept) customizations for
  the configurations defined in `recipe.yaml`. For example, the
  [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) defines a
  [profiles/local.yaml profile](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/profiles/local.yaml) that
  [customizes the dataset used for local model development](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/profiles/local.yaml#L17)
  and [specifies a local MLflow Tracking store for logging model content](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/profiles/local.yaml#L4-L7).
  The [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) also
  defines a |databricks profile| for development on Databricks.

- `tests`: A directory containing Python test code for recipe steps. For example, the
  [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template) implements tests for the transformer and the estimator
  defined in the respective `steps/transform.py` and `steps/train.py` modules.

Shown below is an example [recipe.yaml](https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template/blob/main/recipe.yaml)
configuration file adapted from the [MLflow Recipes Regression Template](#regression-template).
`recipe.yaml` is the main configuration file for a recipe containing aggregated configurations for
all recipe steps; [Profile](#profiles-key-concept)-based substitutions and overrides are supported using
[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating syntax.

```yaml
recipe: "regression/v1"
target_col: "fare_amount"
primary_metrics: "root_mean_squared_error"
steps:
  ingest: {{INGEST_CONFIG}}
  split:
    split_ratios: {{SPLIT_RATIOS|default([0.75, 0.125, 0.125])}}
  transform:
    using: custom
    transformer_method: transformer_fn
  train:
    using: custom
    estimator_method: estimator_fn
  evaluate:
    validation_criteria:
      - metric: root_mean_squared_error
        threshold: 10
      - metric: weighted_mean_squared_error
        threshold: 20
  register:
    allow_non_validated_model: false
custom_metrics:
  - name: weighted_mean_squared_error
    function: weighted_mean_squared_error
    greater_is_better: False
```

### Working with profiles

A profile is a collection of customizations for the configurations defined in the recipe's main
[recipe.yaml](#recipe-template-structure) file. Profiles are defined as YAML files
within the recipe repository's [profiles directory](#profiles-directory). When running a
recipe or inspecting its results, the desired profile is specified as an API or CLI argument.

Example API and CLI workflows for running recipes with different profile customizations

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    import os
    from mlflow.recipes import Recipe

    os.chdir("~/recipes-regression-template")
    # Run the regression recipe to train and evaluate the performance of an ElasticNet regressor
    regression_recipe_local_elasticnet = Recipe(profile="local-elasticnet")
    regression_recipe_local_elasticnet.run()
    # Run the recipe again to train and evaluate the performance of an SGD regressor
    regression_recipe_local_sgd = Recipe(profile="local-sgd")
    regression_recipe_local_sgd.run()
    # After finding the best model type and updating the 'shared-workspace' profile accordingly,
    # run the recipe again to retrain the best model in a workspace where teammates can view it
    regression_recipe_shared = Recipe(profile="shared-workspace")
    regression_recipe_shared.run()
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sh" label="Sh">
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template
    cd recipes-regression-template
    # Run the regression recipe to train and evaluate the performance of an ElasticNet regressor
    mlflow recipes run --profile local-elasticnet
    # Run the recipe again to train and evaluate the performance of an SGD regressor
    mlflow recipes run --profile local-sgd
    # After finding the best model type and updating the 'shared-workspace' profile accordingly,
    # run the recipe again to retrain the best model in a workspace where teammates can view it
    mlflow recipes run --profile shared-workspace
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following profile customizations are supported:

- **overrides**

  - If the `recipe.yaml` configuration file defines a [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)-templated
    attribute with a default value, a profile can override the value by mapping the attribute to a different
    value using YAML dictionary syntax. Note that override values may have arbitrarily nested
    types (e.g. lists, dictionaries, lists of dictionaries, ...).

    Example `recipe.yaml` configuration file defining an overridable
    `RMSE_THRESHOLD` attribute for validating model performance with a
    default value of `10`

    ```yaml
    steps:
      evaluate:
        validation_criteria:
          - metric: root_mean_squared_error
            # The maximum RMSE value on the test dataset that a model can have
            # to be eligible for production deployment
            threshold: { { RMSE_THRESHOLD|default(10) } }
    ```

    Example `prod.yaml` profile that overrides `RMSE_THRESHOLD` with
    a custom value to more aggressively validate model quality for production

    ```yaml
    RMSE_THRESHOLD: 5.2
    ```

- **substitutions**

  - If the `recipe.yaml` configuration file defines a [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)-templated
    attribute without a default value, a profile _must_ map the attribute to a specific value using
    YAML dictionary syntax. Note that substitute values may have arbitrarily nested types
    (e.g. lists, dictionaries, lists of dictionaries, ...).

    Example `recipe.yaml` configuration file defining a `DATASET_INFO`
    variable whose value must be specified by the selected recipe profile

    ```yaml
    # Specifies the dataset to use for model training
    ingest: { { INGEST_CONFIG } }
    ```

    Example `dev.yaml` profile that provides a value for `DATASET_INFO`
    corresponding to a small dataset for development purposes

    ```yaml
    INGEST_CONFIG:
      location: ./data/taxi-small.parquet
      format: parquet
    ```

- **additions**

  - If the `recipe.yaml` configuration file does not define a particular attribute, a
    profile may define it instead. This capability is helpful for providing values of
    optional configurations that, if unspecified, a recipe would otherwise ignore.

    Example `local.yaml` profile that specifies a
    [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)-based
    [MLflow Tracking](/tracking) store for local testing on a laptop

    ```yaml
    experiment:
      tracking_uri: "sqlite:///metadata/mlflow/mlruns.db"
      name: "sklearn_regression_experiment"
      artifact_location: "./metadata/mlflow/mlartifacts"
    ```

:::warning
If the `recipe.yaml` configuration file defines an attribute that cannot be overridden
or substituted (i.e. because its value is not specified using [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)
templating syntax), a profile must not define it. Defining such an attribute in a profile produces an error.
