# Register a Model

Throughout this tutorial we will leverage a local tracking server and model registry for simplicity.
However, for production use cases we recommend using a
[remote tracking server](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/tutorials/remote-server.html).

## Step 0: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade mlflow
```

## Step 1: Register a Model

To use the MLflow model registry, you need to add your MLflow models to it. This is done through
registering a given model via one of the below commands:

- `mlflow.<model_flavor>.log_model(registered_model_name=<model_name>)`: register the model
  **while** logging it to the tracking server.
- `mlflow.register_model(<model_uri>, <model_name>)`: register the model **after** logging it to
  the tracking server. Note that you'll have to log the model before running this command to get a
  model URI.

MLflow has lots of model flavors. In the below example, we'll leverage scikit-learn's
RandomForestRegressor to demonstrate the simplest way to register a model, but note that you
can leverage any [supported model flavor](/models#models_built-in-model-flavors).
In the code snippet below, we start an mlflow run and train a random forest model. We then log some
relevant hyper-parameters, the model mean-squared-error (MSE), and finally log and register the
model itself.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn

with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    X, y = make_regression(n_features=4, n_informative=2, random_state=0, shuffle=False)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )

    params = {"max_depth": 2, "random_state": 42}
    model = RandomForestRegressor(**params)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Log parameters and metrics using the MLflow APIs
    mlflow.log_params(params)

    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mlflow.log_metrics({"mse": mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)})

    # Log the sklearn model and register as version 1
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(
        sk_model=model,
        artifact_path="sklearn-model",
        input_example=X_train,
        registered_model_name="sk-learn-random-forest-reg-model",
    )
```

```bash title="Example Output"
Successfully registered model 'sk-learn-random-forest-reg-model'.
Created version '1' of model 'sk-learn-random-forest-reg-model'.
```

Great! We've registered a model.

Before moving on, let's highlight some important implementation notes.

- To register a model, you can leverage the `registered_model_name` parameter in the <APILink fn="mlflow.sklearn.log_model" />
  or call <APILink fn="mlflow.register_model" /> after logging the model. Generally, we suggest the former because it's more
  concise.
- [Model Signatures](/model/signatures)
  provide validation for our model inputs and outputs. The `input_example` in `log_model()`
  automatically infers and logs a signature. Again, we suggest using this implementation because
  it's concise.
