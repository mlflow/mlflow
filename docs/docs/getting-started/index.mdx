# Getting Started with MLflow

If you're new to MLflow or seeking a refresher on its core functionalities, the
quickstart tutorials here are the perfect starting point. They will guide you
step-by-step through fundamental concepts, focusing purely on a task that will maximize your understanding of
how to use MLflow to solve a particular task.

## Guidance on Running Tutorials

If you have never interfaced with the [MLflow Tracking Server](/tracking/server), we highly encourage you to head on over to quickly **read the guide below**. It
will help you get started as quickly as possible with tutorial content throughout the documentation.

## Getting Started Guides

### MLflow Tracking

[MLflow Tracking](/tracking) is one of the primary service components of MLflow. In these guides, you will gain an understanding of what MLflow Tracking can do to
enhance your MLOps related activities while building ML models.

In these introductory guides to MLflow Tracking, you will learn how to leverage MLflow to:

- **Log** training statistics (loss, accuracy, etc.) and hyperparameters for a model
- **Log** (save) a model for later retrieval
- **Register** a model using the [MLflow Model Registry](/model-registry) to enable deployment
- **Load** the model and use it for inference

In the process of learning these key concepts, you will be exposed to the [MLflow Tracking APIs](/tracking/tracking-api), the MLflow Tracking UI, and learn how to add metadata associated with
a model training event to an MLflow run.

### Autologging Basics

A great way to get started with MLflow is to use the autologging feature. Autologging automatically logs your model, metrics, examples, signature, and parameters
with only a single line of code for many of the most popular ML libraries in the Python ecosystem.

In this brief tutorial, you'll learn how to leverage MLflow's autologging feature to simplify your model logging activities.

### Run Comparison Basics

This quickstart tutorial focuses on the MLflow UI's run comparison feature and provides a step-by-step walkthrough of registering the best model found from a
hyperparameter tuning execution. After locally serving the registered model, a brief example of preparing a model for remote [deployment](/deployment)
by containerizing the model using Docker is covered.
