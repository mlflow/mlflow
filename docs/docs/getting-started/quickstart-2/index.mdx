# Quickstart: Compare runs, choose a model, and deploy it to a REST API

In this quickstart, you will:

- Run a hyperparameter sweep on a training script
- Compare the results of the runs in the MLflow UI
- Choose the best run and register it as a model
- Deploy the model to a REST API
- Build a container image suitable for deployment to a cloud platform

As an ML Engineer or MLOps professional, you can use MLflow to compare, share, and deploy the best models produced
by the team. In this quickstart, you will use the MLflow Tracking UI to compare the results of a hyperparameter
sweep, choose the best run, and register it as a model. Then, you will deploy the model to a REST API. Finally,
you will create a Docker container image suitable for deployment to a cloud platform.

## Set up

For a comprehensive guide on getting an MLflow environment setup that will give you options on how to configure MLflow tracking
capabilities, you can [read the guide here](/getting-started/running-notebooks/).

## Run a hyperparameter sweep

This example tries to optimize the RMSE metric of a Keras deep learning model on a wine quality dataset. It has
two hyperparameters that it tries to optimize: `learning_rate` and `momentum`. We will use the
[Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) library to run a hyperparameter sweep across
different values of `learning_rate` and `momentum` and record the results in MLflow.

Before running the hyperparameter sweep, let's set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable to the URI of
our MLflow tracking server:

```bash
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000
```

:::note
If you would like to explore the possibilities of other tracking server deployments, including a fully-managed
free-of-charge solution with the Databricks Free Trial, please see [this page](/getting-started/running-notebooks/).
:::

Import the following packages

```python
import keras
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from hyperopt import STATUS_OK, Trials, fmin, hp, tpe
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

import mlflow
from mlflow.models import infer_signature
```

Now load the dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets.

```python
# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/master/tests/datasets/winequality-white.csv",
    sep=";",
)

# Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
train_x = train.drop(["quality"], axis=1).values
train_y = train[["quality"]].values.ravel()
test_x = test.drop(["quality"], axis=1).values
test_y = test[["quality"]].values.ravel()
train_x, valid_x, train_y, valid_y = train_test_split(
    train_x, train_y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
signature = infer_signature(train_x, train_y)
```

Then let's define the model architecture and train the model. The `train_model` function uses MLflow to track the
parameters, results, and model itself of each trial as a child run.

```python
def train_model(params, epochs, train_x, train_y, valid_x, valid_y, test_x, test_y):
    # Define model architecture
    mean = np.mean(train_x, axis=0)
    var = np.var(train_x, axis=0)
    model = keras.Sequential(
        [
            keras.Input([train_x.shape[1]]),
            keras.layers.Normalization(mean=mean, variance=var),
            keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"),
            keras.layers.Dense(1),
        ]
    )

    # Compile model
    model.compile(
        optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(
            learning_rate=params["lr"], momentum=params["momentum"]
        ),
        loss="mean_squared_error",
        metrics=[keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError()],
    )

    # Train model with MLflow tracking
    with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
        model.fit(
            train_x,
            train_y,
            validation_data=(valid_x, valid_y),
            epochs=epochs,
            batch_size=64,
        )
        # Evaluate the model
        eval_result = model.evaluate(valid_x, valid_y, batch_size=64)
        eval_rmse = eval_result[1]

        # Log parameters and results
        mlflow.log_params(params)
        mlflow.log_metric("eval_rmse", eval_rmse)

        # Log model
        mlflow.tensorflow.log_model(model, "model", signature=signature)

        return {"loss": eval_rmse, "status": STATUS_OK, "model": model}
```

The `objective` function takes in the hyperparameters and returns the results of the `train_model`
function for that set of hyperparameters.

```python
def objective(params):
    # MLflow will track the parameters and results for each run
    result = train_model(
        params,
        epochs=3,
        train_x=train_x,
        train_y=train_y,
        valid_x=valid_x,
        valid_y=valid_y,
        test_x=test_x,
        test_y=test_y,
    )
    return result
```

Next, we will define the search space for Hyperopt. In this case, we want to try different values of
`learning-rate` and `momentum`. Hyperopt begins its optimization process by selecting an initial
set of hyperparameters, typically chosen at random or based on a specified domain space. This domain
space defines the range and distribution of possible values for each hyperparameter. After evaluating
the initial set, Hyperopt uses the results to update its probabilistic model, guiding the selection
of subsequent hyperparameter sets in a more informed manner, aiming to converge towards the optimal solution.

```python
space = {
    "lr": hp.loguniform("lr", np.log(1e-5), np.log(1e-1)),
    "momentum": hp.uniform("momentum", 0.0, 1.0),
}
```

Finally, we will run the hyperparameter sweep using Hyperopt, passing in the `objective` function and search space.
Hyperopt will try different hyperparameter combinations and return the results of the best one. We will
store the best parameters, model, and evaluation metrics in MLflow.

```python
mlflow.set_experiment("/wine-quality")
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Conduct the hyperparameter search using Hyperopt
    trials = Trials()
    best = fmin(
        fn=objective,
        space=space,
        algo=tpe.suggest,
        max_evals=8,
        trials=trials,
    )

    # Fetch the details of the best run
    best_run = sorted(trials.results, key=lambda x: x["loss"])[0]

    # Log the best parameters, loss, and model
    mlflow.log_params(best)
    mlflow.log_metric("eval_rmse", best_run["loss"])
    mlflow.tensorflow.log_model(best_run["model"], "model", signature=signature)

    # Print out the best parameters and corresponding loss
    print(f"Best parameters: {best}")
    print(f"Best eval rmse: {best_run['loss']}")
```

## Compare the results

Open the MLflow UI in your browser at the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`. You should see a nested list of runs. In the
default **Table view**, choose the **Columns** button and add the **Metrics | eval_rmse** column and
the **Parameters | lr** and **Parameters | momentum** column. To sort by RMSE ascending, click the **eval_rmse**
column header. The best run typically has an RMSE on the **test** dataset of ~0.70. You can see the parameters
of the best run in the **Parameters** column.

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: 800, maxWidth: "100%" }}>
  ![Screenshot of MLflow tracking UI table view showing runs](/images/quickstart_mlops/mlflow_ui_table_view.png)
</div>

Choose **Chart view**. Choose the **Parallel coordinates** graph and configure it to show the **lr** and
**momentum** coordinates and the **eval_rmse** metric. Each line in this graph represents a run and associates
each hyperparameter evaluation run's parameters to the evaluated error metric for the run.

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: 800, maxWidth: "100%" }}>
  ![Screenshot of MLflow tracking UI parallel coordinates graph showing runs](/images/quickstart_mlops/mlflow_ui_chart_view.png)
</div>

The red graphs on this graph are runs that fared poorly. The lowest one is a baseline run with both **lr**
and **momentum** set to 0.0. That baseline run has an RMSE of ~0.89. The other red lines show that
high **momentum** can also lead to poor results with this problem and architecture.

The graphs shading towards blue are runs that fared better. Hover your mouse over individual runs to see their details.

## Register your best model

Choose the best run and register it as a model. In the **Table view**, choose the best run. In the
**Run Detail** page, open the **Artifacts** section and select the **Register Model** button. In the
**Register Model** dialog, enter a name for the model, such as `wine-quality`, and click **Register**.

Now, your model is available for deployment. You can see it in the **Models** page of the MLflow UI.
Open the page for the model you just registered.

You can add a description for the model, add tags, and easily navigate back to the source run that generated
this model. You can also transition the model to different stages. For example, you can transition the model
to **Staging** to indicate that it is ready for testing. You can transition it to **Production** to indicate
that it is ready for deployment.

Transition the model to **Staging** by choosing the **Stage** dropdown:

<div className="center-div" style={{ width: 800, maxWidth: "100%" }}>
  ![Screenshot of MLflow tracking UI models page showing the registered model](/images/quickstart_mlops/register_model_button.png)
</div>

## Serve the model locally

MLflow allows you to easily serve models produced by any run or model version.
You can serve the model you just registered by running:

```bash
mlflow models serve -m "models:/wine-quality/1" --port 5002
```

(Note that specifying the port as above will be necessary if you are running the tracking server on the
same machine at the default port of **5000**.)

You could also have used a `runs:/<run_id>` URI to serve a model, or any supported URI described in [Artifact Store](/tracking#artifact-stores).

Please note that for production, we do not recommend deploying your model in the same VM as the tracking server
because of resource limitation, within this guide we just run everything from the same machine for simplicity.

To test the model, you can send a request to the REST API using the `curl` command:

```bash
curl -d '{"dataframe_split": {
"columns": ["fixed acidity","volatile acidity","citric acid","residual sugar","chlorides","free sulfur dioxide","total sulfur dioxide","density","pH","sulphates","alcohol"],
"data": [[7,0.27,0.36,20.7,0.045,45,170,1.001,3,0.45,8.8]]}}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST localhost:5002/invocations
```

Inferencing is done with a JSON `POST` request to the **invocations** path on **localhost** at the specified port.
The `columns` key specifies the names of the columns in the input data. The `data` value is a list of lists,
where each inner list is a row of data. For brevity, the above only requests one prediction of wine
quality (on a scale of 3-8). The response is a JSON object with a **predictions** key that contains a list of
predictions, one for each row of data. In this case, the response is:

```json
{ "predictions": [{ "0": 5.310967445373535 }] }
```

The schema for input and output is available in the MLflow UI in the **Artifacts | Model** description. The schema
is available because the `train.py` script used the `mlflow.infer_signature` method and passed the result to
the `mlflow.log_model` method. Passing the signature to the `log_model` method is highly recommended, as it
provides clear error messages if the input request is malformed.

## Build a container image for your model

Most routes toward deployment will use a container to package your model, its dependencies, and relevant portions of
the runtime environment. You can use MLflow to build a Docker image for your model.

```bash
mlflow models build-docker --model-uri "models:/wine-quality/1" --name "qs_mlops"
```

This command builds a Docker image named `qs_mlops` that contains your model and its dependencies. The `model-uri`
in this case specifies a version number (`/1`) rather than a lifecycle stage (`/staging`), but you can use
whichever integrates best with your workflow. It will take several minutes to build the image. Once it completes,
you can run the image to provide real-time inferencing locally, on-prem, on a bespoke Internet server, or cloud
platform. You can run it locally with:

```bash
docker run -p 5002:8080 qs_mlops
```

This [Docker run command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) runs the image you just built
and maps port **5002** on your local machine to port **8080** in the container. You can now send requests to the
model using the same `curl` command as before:

```bash
curl -d '{"dataframe_split": {"columns": ["fixed acidity","volatile acidity","citric acid","residual sugar","chlorides","free sulfur dioxide","total sulfur dioxide","density","pH","sulphates","alcohol"], "data": [[7,0.27,0.36,20.7,0.045,45,170,1.001,3,0.45,8.8]]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST localhost:5002/invocations
```

## Deploying to a cloud platform

Virtually all cloud platforms allow you to deploy a Docker image. The process varies considerably, so you will have
to consult your cloud provider's documentation for details.

In addition, some cloud providers have built-in support for MLflow:

- [Azure ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/)
- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/managed-mlflow)
- [Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/mlflow.html)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/doc)

Cloud platforms generally support multiple workflows for deployment: command-line, SDK-based, and web-based.
You can use MLflow in any of these workflows, although the details will vary between
platforms and versions. Again, you will need to consult your cloud provider's documentation for details.
