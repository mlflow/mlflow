mlflow.tracing
==============

.. warning::

    The tracing functionality is experimental and currently only available in Databricks. The feature will be fully supported in open-source MLflow in next major release.

.. attention::

    The ``mlflow.tracing`` namespace only contains a few utility functions fo managing traces. The main entry point for MLflow
    Tracing is :ref:`Tracing Fluent APIs <mlflow-tracing-fluent-python-apis>` defined directly under the
    :py:mod:`mlflow` namespace, or the low-level `Tracing Client APIs <../llms/tracing/index.html#tracing-client-apis>`_
