    "# MLflow + Scikit-learn Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the MLflow [ElasticNet Diabetes example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/sklearn_elasticnet_diabetes). It illustrates how to use MLflow to track the model training process, including logging model parameters, metrics, the model itself, and other artifacts like plots. It also includes instructions for viewing the logged results in the MLflow tracking UI.    \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the scikit-learn `diabetes` dataset and predicts the progression metric (a quantitative measure of disease progression after one year) based on BMI, blood pressure, and other measurements. It uses the scikit-learn ElasticNet linear regression model, varying the `alpha` and `l1_ratio` parameters for tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Regression with Scikit-learn\n",
    "SKlearn is one of the most widely used python libraries for supervised regression, specifically for linear and tree-based algorithms. Linear models provide realtively simple tuning options but, when properly leveraged, are some of the most powerful traditional ML models with regards to predtive accuracy and support for statistical inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Elastic Net Regularization\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on a common regualrization extension to mulitiple linear regression: **Elastic Net**. If you need a refresher and enjoy overly **TODO** videos, check out this [statsquest post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dKRdX9bfIo&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer) explaining the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "ElasticNet is a regularization technique in supervised regression that combines L1 and L2 penalties. The **L1 penalty (Lasso)** encourages sparsity in the model coefficients, effectively performing feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. The **L2 penalty (Ridge)** shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but not exactly to zero, promoting model robustness especially in cases of multicollinearity. ElasticNet blends these two approaches, allowing for both feature selection and regularization to manage correlated variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Elastic Net Penalty} = \\alpha \\cdot l1ratio \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\beta_i| + \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot (1 - \\text{l1\\_ratio}}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\beta_i^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While manual intervention and monitoring is suggested, ElasticNet is one of the most reliable automated methods for removing mutlicolinearity in your feature space. **If you're using linear models and have lots of features, ElasticNet might be a good solution.**\n"

ElasticNet is a regularization technique in supervised regression that combines L1 and L2 penalties, known as Lasso and Ridge regression respectively.

The **L2 penalty (Ridge)** shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but not exactly to zero, promoting model robustness especially in cases of multicollinearity.
