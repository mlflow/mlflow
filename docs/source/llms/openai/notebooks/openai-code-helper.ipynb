    "### Defining and Utilizing the Model Signature in MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the tutorial, we define a `ModelSignature` for our OpenAI model, which is a crucial step in both saving the base model and later in our custom Python Model implementation. Here's an overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Signature Definition**:\n",
    "   - We create a `ModelSignature` object that specifies the input, output, and parameters of our model.\n",
    "   - The `inputs` and `outputs` are defined as schemas with a single string column, indicating that our model will be processing string type data.\n",
    "   - The `params` schema includes two parameters: `max_tokens` and `temperature`, each with a default value and data type defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** We're explicitly defining the model signature here for purposes of demonstration. The schema will be automatically inferred if you do not specify one and will be set based on the `task` that is defined when logging or saving the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logging the Base OpenAI Model**:\n",
    "   - Using `mlflow.openai.log_model`, we log the base OpenAI model (`gpt-4`) along with the `instruction` set we defined earlier.\n",
    "   - The `signature` we defined is also passed in this step, ensuring that the model is saved with the correct specifications for inputs, outputs, and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual-purpose signature is vital as it ensures consistency in how the model processes data both in its base form and when it's later wrapped in a custom Python Model. This approach streamlines the workflow and maintains uniformity across different stages of model implementation and deployment."

    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce a custom Python Model, `CodeHelper`, which significantly improves the user experience when interacting with the OpenAI model in an interactive development environment like Jupyter Notebook. The `CodeHelper` class is designed to format the output from the OpenAI model, making it more readable and visually appealing, similar to a chat interface. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization and Model Loading**:\n",
    "   - The `CodeHelper` class inherits from `PythonModel`.\n",
    "   - The `load_context` method is used to load the OpenAI model, which is saved as `self.model`. This model is loaded from the `context.artifacts`, ensuring that the appropriate model is used for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Formatting**:\n",
    "   - The `_format_response` method is crucial for enhancing the output format.\n",
    "   - It processes each item in the response, handling text and code blocks differently.\n",
    "   - Text lines outside of code blocks are wrapped to a width of 80 characters for better readability.\n",
    "   - Lines within code blocks (marked by `` ``` ``) are not wrapped, preserving the code structure.\n",
    "   - This formatting creates an output that resembles a chat interface, making the interaction more intuitive and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Making Predictions**:\n",
    "   - The `predict` method is where the model’s prediction occurs.\n",
    "   - It calls the loaded OpenAI model to get the raw response for the given input.\n",
    "   - The raw response is then passed to the `_format_response` method for formatting.\n",
    "   - The formatted response is returned, providing a clear and easy-to-read output.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing this custom `pyfunc`, we enhance the user's interaction with the AI code helper. It not only makes the output easier to understand but also presents it in a familiar format, akin to messaging, which is especially beneficial in interactive coding environments."

    "This part of the tutorial demonstrates how to save the custom Python model, `CodeHelper`, using MLflow. The process involves specifying the model's location and additional information to ensure it is properly stored and can be retrieved for future use. Here’s an overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Artifacts**:\n",
    "   - An `artifacts` dictionary is created with a key `\"model_path\"` pointing to the location of the base OpenAI model. This step is important to link our custom model with the necessary base model files. We retrieve the location of the logged openai model from earlier by accessing the `model_uri` property from the return of the `log_model()` function.\n",

    "2. **Saving the Model**:\n",
    "   - The `mlflow.pyfunc.save_model` function is used to save the `CodeHelper` model.\n",
    "   - `path`: Specifies the location (`final_model_path`) where the model will be saved.\n",
    "   - `python_model`: An instance of the `CodeHelper` class is provided, indicating the model to be saved.\n",
    "   - `input_example`: An example input (`[\"x = 1\"]`) is given, which is useful for understanding the model's expected input format.\n",

    "#### Approach 1: The Simple `review` Function\n",
    "Our first approach is a straightforward `review` function. This method is less intrusive and does not modify the original function's behavior. It's ideal for scenarios where you want to manually trigger a review of the function's code and don't need to see the output result of the function to have context of the LLM's analysis.\n",

    "We apply the `code_inspector` decorator to a function named `summing_function`. This function is designed to calculate the sum of sums for a given range. Here's an insight into its functionality and the enhancement brought by `code_inspector`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Overview**:\n",
    "   - `summing_function` calculates the cumulative sum of numbers up to `n`. It does so by iterating over a range and summing the intermediate sums at each step.\n",

    "   - On calling `summing_function(1000)`, the `code_inspector` decorator is the first to activate. This decorator is designed to use the `loaded_helper` model to analyze the decorated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Analyzes the Function Code**:\n",
    "   - `code_inspector` retrieves the source code of `summing_function` using the `inspect` module.\n",
    "   - This source code is then passed to the `loaded_helper` model, which performs an analysis based on its training and provided instructions. The model predicts feedback on code quality, efficiency, and best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feedback Presentation**:\n",
    "   - The feedback generated by the model is printed out. This feedback might include suggestions for code optimization, identification of potential errors, or general advice on coding practices.\n",
    "   - This step provides an educational insight into the code quality before the function executes its logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function Execution**:\n",
    "   - After the feedback is displayed, the `summing_function` proceeds to execute with the input `1000`.\n",
    "   - The function calculates the cumulative sum of numbers up to 1000, but due to its inefficient implementation, this process may be slower and more resource-intensive than necessary.\n",

    "   - The function returns the final computed sum, which is the result of the summing logic implemented within it.\n",

    "3. **Lack of Error Handling**: Directly accessing the first element in `phone_numbers` without checking if the list is empty can lead to an `IndexError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Import Statement Position**: The `import re` statement is inside the function, which is unconventional. Imports are typically placed at the top of a script for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analysis and Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - Due to how we crafted our custom MLflow model in `code_inspector`, the function's issues will be analyzed and feedback will be returned before the function's logic is executed.\n",
    "   - After this analysis, the execution of the function will likely result in an exception (due to the typographical error), demonstrating the importance of careful code review and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `code_inspector` model's review will highlight these coding missteps, emphasizing the value of proper syntax, pattern accuracy, and error handling in Python programming."

      "Here's a detailed review of your code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Errors or Bugs:\n",
      "   - There's a typo in the `re.compile` function. You've written `re.complie`\n",
      "instead of `re.compile`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Suggestions for Optimizing Code Efficiency and Structure:\n",
      "   - The import statement `import re` is inside the function. It's a good\n",
      "practice to keep all import statements at the top of the file. This makes it\n",
      "easier to see what modules are being used in the script.\n",
      "   - The function will throw an error if no phone numbers are found in the text\n",
      "because you're trying to access the first element of `phone_numbers` without\n",
      "checking if it exists. You should add a check to see if any phone numbers were\n",
      "found before trying to access the first one.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Recommendations for Enhancing Code Readability and Maintainability:\n",
      "   - The function name `find_phone_numbers` is clear and descriptive, which is\n",
      "good. However, the variable `pattern` could be more descriptive. Consider\n",
      "renaming it to `phone_number_pattern` or something similar.\n",
      "   - You should add docstrings to your function to describe what it does, what\n",
      "its parameters are, and what it returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Best Practice Advice:\n",
      "   - Use exception handling to catch potential errors and make your program more\n",
      "robust.\n",
      "   - Avoid using print statements in functions that are meant to return a value.\n",
      "If you want to debug, consider using logging instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you could improve your code:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import re\n",
      "\n",
      "def find_phone_numbers(text):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    This function finds all phone numbers in the given text.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Parameters:\n",
      "    text (str): The text to search for phone numbers.\n",

      "    \"\"\"\n",
