    "### Understanding Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are a form of representation learning where words, phrases, or even entire documents are converted into vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic meaning, enabling models to understand and process language more effectively. Embeddings are extensively used in natural language processing (NLP) for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Embeddings Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings work by mapping textual data to vectors such that the distance and direction between vectors represent relationships between the words or phrases. For example, in a well-trained embedding space, synonyms are located closer together, while unrelated terms are farther apart. This spatial arrangement allows algorithms to recognize context and semantics, enhancing their ability to interpret and respond to natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding Endpoint Configuration**: Setting up and utilizing OpenAI's embedding endpoints in MLflow.\n",
    "- **Real-world Application**: Practical example of comparing the text content of various web pages to one another to determine the amount of similarity in their contextually-specific content. \n",
    "- **Efficiency and Precision Enhancements**: Techniques for improving model performance using OpenAI embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a thorough understanding of how to integrate and leverage OpenAI embeddings in your MLflow projects, harnessing the power of advanced NLP techniques. You'll also see a real-world application of using text embeddings of documents to compare their similarity. This use case is particularly useful for web content development as a critical task when performing search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure that site page contents are not too similar to one another (which could result in a downgrade in page rankings). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Required packages\n",

    "In order to run this tutorial, you will need to install ``beautifulsoup4`` from PyPI.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps\n",

The OpenAI endpoint that we've chosen here points to the model \"text-embedding-ada-002\", chosen for its robust embedding capabilities. During this step, we detail these access configurations, the embedding task, input/output schemas, and parameters like batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading the Logged Model for Use**: After logging the MLflow model, we proceed to load it using MLflow's `pyfunc` module. This is a critical step for applying the model to perform document similarity tasks within the MLflow ecosystem.\n",

    "1. **cosine_similarity**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Calculates the cosine similarity between two embedding vectors.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**: This function computes similarity by finding the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, a common method for assessing how similar two documents are in terms of their content.\n",

    "   - **Purpose**: Computes the Euclidean distance between two embedding vectors.\n",
    "   - **Functionality**: Similar to `cosine_similarity` this function calculates the Euclidean distance, which is the \"straight line\" distance between the two points in the embedding space. This measure is useful for understanding how different two documents are.\n",
    "   - **Relevance within NLP**: Offers a more intuitive physical distance metric, useful for tasks like document classification and anomaly detection.\n",

    "  - `id1` and `id2`: Target IDs for the main text content divs on each page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Extraction**: The function starts by extracting text from the specified sections of each webpage using the `extract_text_from_url` function.\n",
    "2. **Embedding Prediction**: It then uses the previously loaded OpenAI model to generate embeddings for the extracted texts.\n",
    "3. **Similarity and Distance Measurement**: The function calculates both the cosine similarity and Euclidean distance between the two embeddings. These metrics provide a quantifiable measure of how similar or dissimilar the webpage contents are.\n",
