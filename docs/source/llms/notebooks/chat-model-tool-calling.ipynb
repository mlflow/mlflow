    "Welcome to the notebook tutorial on building a simple tool calling model using the [mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel) wrapper. ChatModel is a subclass of MLflow's highly customizable [PythonModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel), which was specifically designed to make creating GenAI workflows easier.\n",

Agent-style tool calling models can make many layers of function calls during the lifespan of a single request, so tracing is invaluable in helping us understand what's going on at each step.\n",

MLflow Tracing also has integrations with many popular GenAI frameworks, such as LangChain, OpenAI, LlamaIndex, and more. For the full list, check out this [documentation page](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html#automatic-tracing). In this tutorial, we're using the OpenAI SDK to make API calls, so we can enable tracing for this by calling `mlflow.openai.autolog()`.\n",
