    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline Creation**: We use the `pipeline` function from the Transformers library to create an inference pipeline. This pipeline is configured for the task of text classification.\n",
    "- **Model Integration**: We integrate our fine-tuned model (`trainer.model`) into the pipeline. This ensures that the pipeline uses our newly trained model for inference.\n",
    "- **Configuring the Pipeline**: We set the batch size and tokenizer in the pipeline configuration. Additionally, we specify the device type, which is crucial for performance considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Device Configuration for Different Platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Devices**: For those using Apple Silicon (e.g., M1 or M2 chips), we set the device type to `\"mps\"` in the pipeline. This leverages Apple's Metal Performance Shaders for optimized performance on these devices.\n",
    "- **Other Devices**: If you're using a device other than a MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon, you'll need to adjust the device setting to match your hardware (e.g., `\"cuda\"` for NVIDIA GPUs or `\"cpu\"` for CPU-only inference).\n",

If a model doesn’t perform well, we wouldn't want to log the model, only to have to later delete the run and the logged artifacts.\n",

Logging a poorly performing model would lead to unnecessary complications, especially considering the large size and complexity of these models.\n",
