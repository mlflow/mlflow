LLM Evaluation Examples
=======================

The notebooks listed below contain step-by-step tutorials on how to use MLflow to evaluate LLMs. 
The first notebook is centered around evaluating an LLM for question-answering with a 
prompt engineering approach. The second notebook is centered around evaluating a RAG system. 
Both notebooks will demonstrate how to use MLflow's builtin metrics such as token_count and 
toxicity as well as LLM-judged intelligent metrics such as answer_relevance.
