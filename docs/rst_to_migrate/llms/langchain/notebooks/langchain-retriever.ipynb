    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial, where we explore the integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with MLflow and LangChain. Our focus is on demonstrating how to create advanced RAG systems and showcasing the unique capabilities enabled by MLflow in these applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding RAG and how to develop one with MLflow\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of language model generation with information retrieval, allowing language models to access and incorporate external data. This approach significantly enriches the model's responses with detailed and context-specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow is instrumental in this process. As an open-source platform, it facilitates the logging, tracking, and deployment of complex models, including RAG chains. With MLflow, integrating LangChain becomes more streamlined, enhancing the development, evaluation, and deployment processes of RAG models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: In this tutorial, we'll be using GPT-3.5 as our base language model. It's important to note that the results obtained from a RAG system will differ from those obtained by interfacing directly with GPT models. RAG's unique approach of combining external data retrieval with language model generation creates more nuanced and contextually rich responses.\n",

    "For this tutorial, we will be utilizing [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki) (Facebook AI Similarity Search, developed and maintained by the [Meta AI research group](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/)), an efficient similarity search and clustering library. It's a highly useful library that easily handles large datasets and is capable of performing operations such as nearest neighbor search, which are critical in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. There are numerous other vector database solutions that can perform similar functionality; we are using FAISS in this tutorial due to its simplicity, ease of use, and fantastic performance.\n",

    "- **Database Integration**: In this example, we've created a FAISS database from historical documents, such as the Act Establishing Yellowstone National Park. This database is used by the RetrievalQA model to find relevant sections of text.\n",
    "- **Query Processing**: When we execute `loaded_model.predict([{\"query\": \"What does the document say about trespassers?\"}])`, the model first searches the database for parts of the document that are most relevant to the query about trespassers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Is This Response Different?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context-Specific Answers**: Unlike a direct query to GPT-3.5, which might generate an answer based on its training data without specific context, the RetrievalQA model provides a response directly derived from the specific documents in the database.\n",
    "- **Accurate and Relevant**: The response is more accurate and contextually relevant because it's based on the actual content of the specific document being queried.\n",
    "- **No Generalization**: There's less generalization or assumption in the response. The RetrievalQA model is not \"guessing\" based on its training; it's providing information directly sourced from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaway:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This methodology demonstrates how MLflow and LangChain facilitate complex RAG use cases, where direct interaction with historical or specific texts yields more precise answers than generic language model predictions.\n",
    "- The tutorial highlights how leveraging RAG can be particularly useful in scenarios where responses need to be grounded in specific texts or documents, showcasing a powerful blend of retrieval and generation capabilities."

    "### Analyzing the Bridle-Path Query Response\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the tutorial showcases an interesting aspect of the RetrievalQA model's capabilities, particularly in handling queries that involve both specific information retrieval and additional context generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query and Response Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query**: The user asks, \"What is a bridle-path and can I use one at Yellowstone?\"\n",
    "- **Response**: The model responds by explaining what a bridle-path is and confirms that bridle-paths can be used at Yellowstone based on the act.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Response Dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combining Document Data with LLM Context**: \n",
    "   - The query about bridle-paths isn't directly answered in the act establishing Yellowstone. \n",
    "   - The model uses its language understanding capabilities to provide a definition of a bridle-path.\n",
    "   - It then merges this information with the context it retrieves from the FAISS database about the act, particularly regarding the construction of roads and bridle-paths in the park.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: \n",
    "   - The RetrievalQA model demonstrates an ability to supplement direct information from the database with additional context through its language model.\n",
    "   - This approach provides a more comprehensive answer that aligns with the user’s query, showing a blend of document-specific data and general knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why This Is Notable**:\n",
    "   - Unlike a standard LLM response, the RetrievalQA model doesn't solely rely on its training data for general responses.\n",
    "   - It effectively integrates specific document information with broader contextual understanding, offering a more nuanced answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaway:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This example highlights how MLflow and LangChain, through the RetrievalQA model, facilitate a sophisticated response mechanism. The model not only retrieves relevant document information but also intelligently fills in gaps with its own language understanding capabilities.\n",
    "- Such a response mechanism is particularly useful when dealing with queries that require both specific document references and additional contextual information, showcasing the advanced capabilities of RAG in practical applications."

    "#### Query Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Query**: \"Can I buy Yellowstone from the Federal Government to set up a buffalo-themed day spa?\"\n",
    "- **The Response**: The model, with a straight face, responds, \"No, you cannot buy Yellowstone from the Federal Government to set up a buffalo-themed day spa.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Peek into the Model's Thought Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct and No-Nonsense Response**: \n",
    "   - Despite the query's comedic undertone, the model gives a direct and clear-cut response. It's like the model is saying, \"Nice try, but no, you can't do that.\"\n",
    "   - This highlights the model's ability to remain factual, even when faced with a question that's clearly more humorous than serious.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Legal Boundaries**: \n",
    "   - The response respects the legal and regulatory sanctity of national parks. It seems our model takes the protection of national treasures like Yellowstone pretty seriously!\n",
    "   - The model's training on legal and general knowledge assists in delivering a response that's accurate, albeit the question being a facetious one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contrast with Traditional LLM Responses**: \n",
    "   - A traditional LLM might have given a more generic answer. In contrast, our model, equipped with context-specific data, promptly debunks the whimsical idea of buying a national park for a spa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Dash of Humor in Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The query, while absurd, serves as an amusing example of the model's capability to provide contextually relevant answers to even the most far-fetched questions.\n",
    "- It's a reminder that learning can be both informative and entertaining. In this case, the model plays the role of a straight-faced comedian, addressing a wildly imaginative business proposal with a firm yet comical \"No.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while you can't buy Yellowstone for your buffalo-themed spa dreams, you can certainly enjoy the park's natural beauty... just as a visitor, not as a spa owner!\n"
