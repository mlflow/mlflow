    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we delve into the world of language translation by leveraging the power of [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) and MLflow. This guide is crafted for practitioners with a grasp of machine learning concepts who seek to streamline their translation model workflows. We will showcase the use of MLflow to log, manage, and serve a cutting-edge translation model - the `google/flan-t5-base` from the [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) library."

    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct a translation **pipeline** using `flan-t5-base` from the Transformers library.\n",
    "- **Log** the translation model and its configurations using MLflow.\n",
    "- Determine the input and output **signature** of the translation model automatically.\n",
    "- **Retrieve** a logged translation model from MLflow for direct interaction.\n",
    "- Emulate the deployment of the translation model using MLflow's **pyfunc** model flavor for language translation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the conclusion of this tutorial, you'll gain a thorough insight into managing and deploying translation models with MLflow, thereby enhancing your machine learning operations for language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why was this model chosen?\n",
    "The [flan-t5-base](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base) offers a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size**: it's a relatively small model for the comparatively powerful performance.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Language Coverage**: Expanding on the original [T5 model](https://huggingface.co/t5-base), the flan-t5 has a much larger breadth of languages that it supports."

    "``` text\n",
    "    `\"J'ai appr√©ci√© ma lente promenade le long des Champs-√âlys√©es.\"`\n",

    "This version corrects grammatical gender and adds necessary articles, accentuation, and hyphenation. These subtle nuances enhance the translation quality significantly.\n",
