    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Many powerful open-source LLMs have emerged and are easily accessible. However, they are not designed to be deployed to your production environment out-of-the-box; instead, you have to **fine-tune** them for your specific tasks, such as a chatbot, content generation, etc. One challenge, though, is that training LLMs is usually very expensive. Even if your dataset for fine-tuning is small, the backpropagation step needs to compute gradients for billions of parameters. For example, fully fine-tuning the Llama7B model requires 112GB of VRAM, i.e. at least two 80GB A100 GPUs. Fortunately, there are many research efforts on how to reduce the cost of LLM fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to build a powerful **text-to-SQL** generator by fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model with **a single 24GB VRAM GPU**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "1. Hands-on learning of the typical LLM fine-tuning process.\n",
    "2. Understand how to use **QLoRA** and **PEFT** to overcome the GPU memory limitation for fine-tuning.\n",
    "3. Manage the model training cycle using **MLflow** to log the model artifacts, hyperparameters, metrics, and prompts.\n",
    "4. How to save prompt template and inference parameters (e.g. max_token_length) in MLflow to simplify prediction interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Actors\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn about the techniques and methods behind efficient LLM fine-tuning by actually running the code. There are more detailed explanations for each cell below, but let's start with a brief preview of a few main important libraries/methods used in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) model is a pretrained text-generation model with 7 billion parameters, developed by [mistral.ai](https://mistral.ai/). The model employs various optimization techniques such as Group-Query Attention, Sliding-Window Attention, Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer, and outperforms the Llama 2 13B on benchmarks with fewer parameters.\n",
    "* [QLoRA](https://github.com/artidoro/qlora) is a novel method that allows us to fine-tune large foundational models with limited GPU resources. It reduces the number of trainable parameters by learning pairs of rank-decomposition matrices and also applies 4-bit quantization to the frozen pretrained model to further reduce the memory footprint.\n",
    "* [PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/index) is a library developed by HuggingFaceðŸ¤—, that enables developers to easily integrate various optimization methods with pretrained models available on the HuggingFace Hub. With PEFT, you can apply QLoRA to the pretrained model with a few lines of configurations and run fine-tuning just like the normal Transformers model training.\n",
    "* [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) manages an exploding number of configurations, assets, and metrics during the LLM training on your behalf. MLflow is natively integrated with Transformers and PEFT, and plays a crucial role in organizing the fine-tuning cycle."

    "Next, we'll load the Mistral 7B model, which will serve as our base model for fine-tuning. This model can be loaded from the HuggingFace Hub repository [mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) using the Transformers' `from_pretrained()` API. However, here we are also providing a `quantization_config` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter embodies the key technique of [QLoRA](https://github.com/artidoro/qlora) that significantly reduces memory usage during fine-tuning. The following paragraph details the method and the implications of this configuration. However, feel free to skip if it appears complex. After all, we rarely need to modify the `quantization_config` values ourselves :)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, QLoRA is a combination of **Q**uantization and **LoRA**. To grasp its functionality, it's simpler to begin with LoRA. [LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation)](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA) is a preceding method for resource-efficient fine-tuning, by reducing the number of trainable parameters through matrix decomposition. Let `W'` represent the final weight matrix from fine-tuning. In LoRA, `W'` is approximated by the sum of the original weight and its update, i.e., `W + Î”W`, then decomposing the delta part into two low-dimensional matrices, i.e., `Î”W â‰ˆ AB`. Suppose `W` is `m`x`m`, and we select a smaller `r` for the rank of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `m`x`r` and `B` is `r`x`m`. Now, the original trainable parameters, which are quadratic in size of `W` (i.e., `m^2`), after decomposition, become `2mr`. Empirically, we can choose a much smaller number for `r`, e.g., 32, 64, compared to the full weight matrix size, therefore this significantly reduces the number of parameters to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "[QLoRA](https://github.com/artidoro/qlora) extends LoRA, employing the same strategy for matrix decomposition. However, it further reduces memory usage by applying 4-bit quantization to the frozen pretrained model `W`. According to their research, the largest memory usage during LoRA fine-tuning is the backpropagation through the frozen parameters `W` to compute gradients for the adaptors `A` and `B`. Thus, quantizing `W` to 4-bit significantly reduces the overall memory consumption. This is achieved with the `load_in_4bit=True` setting shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, QLoRA introduces additional techniques to optimize resource usage without significantly impacting model performance. For more technical details, please refer to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14314.pdf), but we implement them by setting the following quantization configurations in bitsandbytes:\n",
    "* The 4-bit NormalFloat type is specified by `bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\"`.\n",
    "* Double quantization is activated by `bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True`.\n",
    "* QLoRA re-quantizes the 4-bit weights back to a higher precision when computing the gradients for `A` and `B`, to prevent performance degradation. This datatype is specified by `bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16`.\n"

    "Finally, we will call [mlflow.transformers.log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.transformers.html#mlflow.transformers.log_model) API to log the model to MLflow. A few critical points to remember when logging a PEFT model to MLflow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MLflow logs the Transformer model as a [Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines).** A pipeline bundles a model with its tokenizer (or other components, depending on the task type) and simplifies the prediction steps into an easy-to-use interface, making it an excellent tool for ensuring reproducibility. In the code below, we pass the model and tokenizer as a dictionary, then MLflow automatically deduces the correct pipeline type and saves it.\n",
    "2. **MLflow does not save the base model weight for the PEFT model**. When executing `mlflow.transformers.log_model`, MLflow only saves the small number of trained parameters, i.e., the PEFT adapter. For the base model, MLflow instead records a reference to the HuggingFace hub (repository name and commit hash), and downloads the base model weights on the fly when loading the PEFT model. This approach significantly reduces storage usage and logging latency; for instance, the logged artifacts size in this tutorial is less than 1GB, while the full Mistral 7B model is about 20GB.\n",
    "3. **Save a tokenizer without padding**. During fine-tuning, we applied padding to the dataset to standardize the sequence length in a batch. However, padding is no longer necessary at inference, so we save a different tokenizer without padding. This ensures the loaded model can be used for inference immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Currently, manual logging is required for the PEFT adapter and config, while other information, such as dataset, metrics, Trainer parameters, etc., are automatically logged. However, this process may be automated in future versions of MLflow and Transformers."

    "1. Use [mlflow.transformers.load_model()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.transformers.html#mlflow.transformers.load_model). This method returns a native Transformers pipeline instance.\n",
    "2. Use [mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.load_model). This method returns an MLflow's PythonModel instance that wraps the Transformers pipeline, offering additional features over the native pipeline, such as (1) a unified `predict()` API for inference, (2) model signature enforcement, and (3) automatically applying a prompt template and default parameters if saved. Please note that not all the Transformer pipelines are supported for pyfunc loading, refer to the [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/guide/index.html#supported-transformers-pipeline-types-for-pyfunc) for the full list of supported pipeline types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first option is preferable if you wish to use the model via the native Transformers interface. The second option offers a simplified and unified interface across different model types and is particularly useful for model testing before production deployment. In the following code, we will use the [mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.load_model) to show how it applies the prompt template and the default inference parameters defined above.\n",

    "**NOTE**: Invoking `load_model()` loads a new model instance onto your GPU, which may exceed GPU memory limits and trigger an Out Of Memory (OOM) error, or cause the Transformers library to attempt to offload parts of the model to other devices or disk. This offloading can lead to issues, such as a \"ValueError: We need an `offload_dir` to dispatch this model according to this `decide_map`.\" If you encounter this error, consider restarting the Python Kernel and loading the model again.\n",
    "\n",
