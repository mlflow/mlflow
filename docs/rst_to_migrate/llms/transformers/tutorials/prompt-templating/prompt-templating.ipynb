    "\n",
    "- Set up a text generation pipeline using TinyLlama-1.1B as an example model\n",
    "- Set a prompt template that will be used to format user queries at inference time\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is a prompt template, and why use one?\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large language models, the way a query is structured can significantly impact the model's performance. We often need to add some preamble, or format the query in a way that gives us the results that we want. It's not ideal to expect the end-user of our applications to know exactly what this format should be, so we typically have a pre-processing step to format the user input in a way that works best with the underlying model. In other words, we apply a prompt template to the user's input.\n",

    "MLflow provides a convenient way to set this on certain pipeline types using the `transformers` flavor. As of now, the only pipelines that we support are:\n",

This is to prevent the template from being shown to the users, which could potentially cause confusion as it was not part of their original input.
