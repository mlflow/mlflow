    "Welcome to the notebook tutorial on building a simple tool calling model using the [mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel) wrapper. ChatModel is a subclass of MLflow's highly customizable [PythonModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel), which was specifically designed to make creating GenAI workflows easier.\n",

    "1. No need to define a complex signature! Chat models often accept complex inputs with many levels of nesting, and this can be cumbersome to define yourself.\n",
    "2. Support for JSON / dict inputs (no need to wrap inputs or convert to Pandas DataFrame)\n",
    "3. Includes the use of Dataclasses for defining expected inputs / outputs for a simplified development experience\n",

Agent-style tool calling models can make many layers of function calls during the lifespan of a single request, so tracing is invaluable in helping us understand what's going on at each step.\n",

    "Integrating tracing is easy, we simply decorate the functions we're interested in (`get_weather()` and `predict()`) with `@mlflow.trace`! MLflow Tracing also has integrations with many popular GenAI frameworks, such as LangChain, OpenAI, LlamaIndex, and more. For the full list, check out this [documentation page](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html#automatic-tracing). In this tutorial, we're using the OpenAI SDK to make API calls, so we can enable tracing for this by calling `mlflow.openai.autolog()`.\n",
