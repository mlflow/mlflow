    "[Vector store indexes](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/vector_stores/) are one of the core components in LlamaIndex. They contain embedding vectors of ingested document chunks (and sometimes the document chunks as well). These vectors enable various types of inference, such as query engines, chat engines, and retrievers, each serving different purposes in LlamaIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Engine:**\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Perform straightforward queries to retrieve relevant information based on a userâ€™s question.\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** Ideal for fetching concise answers or documents matching specific queries, similar to a search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chat Engine:**\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Engage in conversational AI tasks that require maintaining context and history over multiple interactions.\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** Suitable for interactive applications like customer support bots or virtual assistants, where conversation context is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retriever:**\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Retrieve documents or text segments that are semantically similar to a given input.\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** Useful in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to fetch relevant context or background information, enhancing the quality of generated responses in tasks like summarization or question answering.\n",
