Tutorial: Custom GenAI Models using ChatModel
=============================================

The rapidly evolving landscape of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents exciting opportunities and integration challenges.
To leverage the latest GenAI advancements effectively, developers need a framework that balances flexibility with standardization. 
MLflow addresses this need with the :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` class introduced in 
`version 2.11.0 <https://mlflow.org/releases/2.11.0#chatmodel-interface-for-a-unified-chat-experience-with-pyfunc-models>`_, providing a 
consistent interface for GenAI applications while simplifying deployment and testing.

Choosing Between ChatModel and PythonModel
------------------------------------------

When building GenAI applications in MLflow, it's essential to choose the right model abstraction that balances ease of use with the level of 
customization you need. MLflow offers two primary classes for this purpose: :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` and 
:py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel`. Each has its own strengths and trade-offs, making it crucial to understand which one best suits your use case.

**When to Use ChatModel**

- **Simplified Interface**: :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` provides a streamlined interface specifically designed for conversational AI applications. 
  It adheres to a standardized input-output format compatible with popular GenAI services like OpenAI, ensuring consistency across deployments.
  
- **Standardization**: This model type enforces the widely adopted OpenAI API specification, which simplifies model deployment and integration 
  by reducing the need to handle complex input schemas manually.

- **Quick Start**: If your goal is to get started quickly with minimal setup, :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` is an excellent choice. It abstracts away 
  much of the complexity, allowing you to focus on your application logic rather than on managing detailed model signatures.

- **Less Customization**: The trade-off for this simplicity is a more rigid structure. :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` is ideal when your use case aligns 
  well with the standardized interface, but it might restrict you if you need to deviate from the prescribed input-output patterns.

**When to Use PythonModel**

- **Full Customization**: :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` offers complete control over the input, output, and processing logic of your model. This makes 
  it the preferred choice when building highly customized applications or when integrating with models and services that don't follow a standardized API.

- **Complex Integrations**: If your application requires complex data processing, multiple steps of data transformation, or integration with 
  unique APIs that donâ€™t conform to a standard schema, :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` provides the flexibility needed to handle these tasks.

- **Increased Complexity**: However, with great flexibility comes increased complexity. Using :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` requires you to define and manage 
  your model's input and output signatures, which can be more challenging, particularly when handling JSON structures common in GenAI use cases.

**Key Considerations**

- **ChatModel Pros**: Simplicity, standardization, faster deployment, less code to manage.
- **ChatModel Cons**: Limited flexibility, standardized inputs may not fit all custom needs.
- **PythonModel Pros**: Highly customizable, can handle any input/output format, adaptable to complex requirements.
- **PythonModel Cons**: More setup required, potentially more prone to errors in defining custom signatures, requires careful management of input transformations.

**Recommendation**: Use :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` when you need a quick, standardized, and reliable solution for conversational agents that align with 
popular GenAI interfaces. Opt for :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` when your project demands flexibility and the ability to customize every aspect of your 
model's behavior.

            <h3>Tracing Customization for GenAI</h3>
        
        |

        `MLflow Tracing <../tracing/index.html>`_ allows you to monitor and log the execution of your model's methods, providing valuable insights during debugging and performance optimization.

        In our example ``BasicAgent`` implementation we utilize two separate APIs for the initiation of trace spans: the decorator API and the fluent API. 

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Decorator API</h4>

        .. code-block:: python

            @mlflow.trace
            def _get_system_message(self, role: str) -> Dict:
                if role not in self.models:
                    raise ValueError(f"Unknown role: {role}")

                instruction = self.models[role]["instruction"]
                return ChatMessage(role="system", content=instruction).to_dict()
        
        Using the :py:func:`@mlflow.trace <mlflow.trace>` tracing decorator is the simplest way to add tracing functionality to functions and methods. By default, a span that is generated from 
        the application of this decorator will utilize the name of the function as the name of the span. It is possible to override this naming, as well as
        other parameters associated with the span, as follows:

        .. code-block:: python

            @mlflow.trace(name="custom_span_name", attributes={"key": "value"}, span_type="func")
            def _get_system_message(self, role: str) -> Dict:
                if role not in self.models:
                    raise ValueError(f"Unknown role: {role}")

                instruction = self.models[role]["instruction"]
                return ChatMessage(role="system", content=instruction).to_dict()
        
        .. tip::
            It is always advised to set a human-readable name for any span that you generate, particularly if you are instrumenting private or generically 
            named functions or methods. The MLflow Trace UI will display the name of the function or method by default, which can be confusing to follow 
            if your functions and methods are ambiguously named.

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Fluent API</h4>

        The :py:func:`fluent APIs <mlflow.start_span>` context handler implementation for initiating spans is useful when you need full control of the logging of each aspect of the span's data. 
        
        The example from our application for ensuring that we're capturing the parameters that are set when loading the model via the ``load_context`` method is 
        shown below. We are pulling from the instance attributes ``self.models_config`` and ``self.models`` to set the attributes of the span.

        .. code-block:: python

            with mlflow.start_span("Audit Agent") as root_span:
                root_span.set_inputs(messages)
                attributes = {**params.to_dict(), **self.models_config, **self.models}
                root_span.set_attributes(attributes)
                # More span manipulation...

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Traces in the MLflow UI</h4>

        After running our example that includes these combined usage patterns for trace span generation and instrumentation,

            <h3>Model Customization for GenAI</h3>
        
        |

        In order to control the behavior of our ``BasicAgent`` model without having to hard-code configuration values directly into our model logic, specifying
        configurations within the ``model_config`` parameter when logging the model gives some flexibility and versatility to our model definition.
        
        This functionality allows us to:

        - **Rapidly test** different configurations without having to make changes to source code
        - **See the configuration** that was used when logging different iterations directly in the MLflow UI
        - **Simplify the model code** by decoupling the configuration from the implementation 

        .. note::

            In our example model, we set a standard set of configurations that control the behavior of the ``BasicAgent``. The configuration 
            structure expected by the code is a dictionary with the following components:

            - ``models``: Defines the per-agent configurations.
            - ``(model_name)``: Represents the role of the agent. This section contains:

                - ``endpoint``: The specific model type being used by the agent.
                - ``instruction``: The prompt given to the model, describing its role and responsibilities.
                - ``temperature``: The temperature setting controlling response variability.
                - ``max_tokens``: The maximum token limit for generating responses.
            
            - ``configuration``: Contains miscellaneous settings for the agent application.
            
                - ``user_response_instruction``: Provides context for the second agent by simulating a user response based on the first agent's output.

        This configuration structure definition will be:

        - **Defined when logging the model** and structured to support the needs of the model's behavior
        - **Used by the load_context method** and applied to the model when loading
        - **Logged within the MLmodel file** and will be visible within the artifact viewer in the MLflow UI

        The ``model_config`` values that are submitted for our ``BasicAgent`` example within this tutorial can be seen within the logged model's
        ``MLmodel`` file in the UI:

        .. raw:: html

            <h3>Standardization for GenAI Models</h3>
        
        |

        One of the more complex tasks associated with deploying a GenAI application with MLflow arises when attempting to build a custom implementation
        that is based on subclassing the :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` abstraction. 

        While ``PythonModel`` is recommended for custom Deep Learning and traditional Maching Learning models (such as ``sklearn`` or ``torch`` models that require
        additional processing logic apart from that of a base model), there are internal manipulations of the input data that occur
        when serving these models that introduce unneccessary complications with GenAI applications. 

        Due to the fact that DL and traditional ML models largely rely on structured data, when input data is passed via a REST interface for model serving,
        the ``PythonModel`` implementation will convert JSON data into ``pandas.DataFrame`` or ``numpy`` objects. This conversion creates a confusing and difficult to
        debug scenario when using GenAI models. GenAI implementations generally deal exclusively with JSON-conformant data structures and have no tabular 
        representation that makes intuitive sense, thereby creating a frustrating and complex conversion interface needed to make application deployment function
        correctly. 

        To simplify this problem, the :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` class was created to provide a simpler interface for handling of the data
        passed into and returned from a call to the ``predict()`` method on custom Python models serving GenAI use cases. 

        In the example tutorial code below, we subclass ``ChatModel`` in order to utilize this simplified interface with its immutable input and output 
        formats. Because of this immutability, we don't have to reason about model signatures, and can instead directly use API standards that have 
        been broadly accepted throughout the GenAI industry. 

        To illustrate why it is preferred to use ``ChatModel`` as a super class to custom GenAI implementations in MLflow, here is the signature that
        would otherwise need to be defined and supplied during model logging to conform to the ``OpenAI`` API spec as of September 2024:

        **Input Schema** as a ``dict``:

        .. code-block:: python

            [
                {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "content": {"type": "string", "required": True},
                            "name": {"type": "string", "required": False},
                            "role": {"type": "string", "required": True},
                        },
                    },
                    "name": "messages",
                    "required": True,
                },
                {"type": "double", "name": "temperature", "required": False},
                {"type": "long", "name": "max_tokens", "required": False},
                {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "name": "stop", "required": False},
                {"type": "long", "name": "n", "required": False},
                {"type": "boolean", "name": "stream", "required": False},
                {"type": "double", "name": "top_p", "required": False},
                {"type": "long", "name": "top_k", "required": False},
                {"type": "double", "name": "frequency_penalty", "required": False},
                {"type": "double", "name": "presence_penalty", "required": False},
            ]

        .. note::

            Agent-based (tool-calling) schemas are significantly more complex than the simpler chat interface example shown above. As GenAI frameworks and services 
            evolve with increasingly sophisticated capabilities and features, the complexity of these interfaces will grow, making manual schema definitions a 
            challenging and time-consuming task. The structured input validation provided by the MLflow :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` interface removes the burden of defining and 
            managing these intricate signatures manually. By leveraging these pre-defined schemas, you gain robust input type safety and validation, ensuring your 
            deployed applications handle inputs consistently and correctly without additional effort. This approach not only reduces the risk of errors but also 
            streamlines the development process, allowing you to focus on building impactful GenAI solutions without the overhead of managing complex input specifications.


        By using :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel` to base a custom implementation off of, we don't have to reason about this complex signature.
        It is provided for us.

        The only two considerations to be aware of when interfacing with the static signatures of ``ChatModel`` are:
         
        - If the service that your custom implementation is interfacing with doesn't adhere to the ``OpenAI`` spec, you will need to extract data from the
          standard structure of :py:class:`mlflow.types.llm.ChatMessage` and :py:class:`mlflow.types.llm.ChatParams` and ensure that it conforms to what 
          your service is expecting. 

        - The returned response from ``predict`` should adhere to the output structure defined within the ``ChatModel`` output signature: 
          :py:class:`mlflow.types.llm.ChatResponse`. 
    
    .. tab:: Pitfalls

        .. raw:: html

            <h3>Common GenAI pitfalls in MLflow</h3>
        
        |

        There are a number of ways that building a custom implementation for a GenAI use case can be frustrating or not intuitive. Here are some of the
        most common that we've heard from our users:

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Not using a supported flavor</h4>

        If you're working with a library that is natively supported in MLflow, leveraging the built-in support for logging and loading your implementation
        will always be easier than implementing a custom model. It is recommended to check the `supported GenAI flavors <../index.html#native-mlflow-flavors-for-llms>`_
        to see if there is a built-in solution that will meet your use case needs in one of the many integrations that are available.

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Misinterpreting what <code>load_context</code> does</h4>

        While subclassing one of the base model types for a custom model, it may appear that the class definition is a "what you see is what you get" standard
        Python class. However, when loading your custom model instance, the ``load_context`` method is actually called by another loader object. 

        Because of the implementation, you **cannot have direct assignment of undefined instance attributes** within ``load_context``. 

        For example, this does not work:

        .. code-block:: python

            from mlflow.pyfunc import ChatModel


            class MyModel(ChatModel):
                def __init__(self):
                    self.state = []

                def load_context(self, context):
                    # This will fail on load as the instance attribute self.my_model_config is not defined
                    self.my_model_config = context.get("my_model_config")

        Instead, ensure that any instance attributes that are set by the ``load_context`` method are defined in the class constructor with a
        placeholder value:

        .. code-block:: python
            
            from mlflow.pyfunc import ChatModel


            class MyModel(ChatModel):
                def __init__(self):
                    self.state = []
                    self.my_model_config = None  # Define the attribute here

                def load_context(self, context):
                    self.my_model_config = context.get("my_model_config")

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Failing to Handle Secrets securely</h4>
        
        It might be tempting to simplify your model's deployment by specifying authentication secrets within a configuration. However, any configuration
        data that is defined within your ``model_config`` parameters **is directly visible in the MLflow UI** and is not stored securely. 

        The recommended approach for handling sensitive configuration data such as API keys or access tokens is to utilize a Secret Manager. 
        The configuration for **what to fetch** from your secrets management system can be stored within the ``model_config`` definition and 
        your deployment environment can utilize a secure means of accessing the key reference for your secrets management service. 

        An effective place to handle secrets assignment (generally set as environment variables or passed as a part of request headers) is to 
        handle the acquisition and per-session setting within ``load_context``. If you have rotating tokens, it is worthwhile to embed the acquisition
        of secrets and re-fetching of them upon expiry as part of a retry mechanism within the call stack of ``predict``.

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Failing to use <code>input_example</code></h4>  

        While it may seem that providing an ``input_example`` when logging a model in MLflow is purely for cosmetic purposes within the artifact view
        display within the MLflow UI, there is an additional bit of functionality that makes providing this data very useful, particularly for GenAI
        use cases. 

        When an ``input_example`` is provided, MLflow will call your model's ``predict`` method with the example data to validate that the input is
        compatible with the model object that you are logging. If there are any failures that occur, you will receive an error message detailing
        what is wrong with the input syntax. This is very beneficial to ensure that, at the point of logging, you can ensure that your expected
        input interface structure is what will be allowable for the deployed model, thereby saving you hours of debugging and troubleshooting later
        when attempting to deploy your solution. 

        It is **highly recommended** to supply this example during logging.

        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Failing to handle retries for Rate Limits being hit</h4> 

        Nearly all GenAI provider services impose rate limits and token-based usage limits to prevent disruption to their service or to help protect
        users from unexpected bills. When limits are reached, it is important that your prediction logic is robust to handle these failures to ensure
        that a user of your deployed application understands why their request was not successful.

        It can be beneficial to introduce retry logic for certain errors, particularly those involving transient connection issues or per-unit-of-time 
        request limits.  


        .. raw:: html

            <h4>Not validating before deployment</h4>
        
        The process of deploying a GenAI application can a significant amount of time. When an implementation is finally ready to be submitted to a 
        serving environment, the last thing that you want to deal with is a model that is incapable of being served due to some issue with a decoded 
        JSON payload being submitted to your model's ``predict()`` method. 

        MLflow offers the :py:func:`mlflow.models.validate_serving_input` API to ensure that the model that you have logged is capable of being interacted 
        with by emulating the data processing that occurs with a deployed model. 

        To use this API, simply navigate to your logged model with the MLflow UI's artifact viewer. The model display pane on the right side of
        the artifact viewer contains the code snippet that you can execute in an interactive environment to ensure that your model is ready to 
        deploy. 

        For the example in this tutorial, this is the generated code that is copied from the artifact viewer display:

        .. code-block:: python

            from mlflow.models import validate_serving_input

            model_uri = "runs:/8935b7aff5a84f559b5fcc2af3e2ea31/model"

            # The model is logged with an input example. MLflow converts
            # it into the serving payload format for the deployed model endpoint,
            # and saves it to 'serving_input_payload.json'
            serving_payload = """{
            "messages": [
                {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is a good recipe for baking scones that doesn't require a lot of skill?"
                }
            ],
            "temperature": 1.0,
            "n": 1,
            "stream": false
            }"""

            # Validate the serving payload works on the model
            validate_serving_input(model_uri, serving_payload)


Key Classes and Methods in our example
--------------------------------------

- ``BasicAgent``: Our custom chat agent class that extends ``ChatModel``.
- ``_get_system_message``: Retrieves the system message configuration for a specific role.
- ``_get_agent_response```: Sends messages to an endpoint and retrieves responses.
- ``_call_agent``: Manages the conversation flow between the agent roles.
- ``_prepare_message_list```: Prepares the list of messages for sending.
- ``load_context``: Initializes the model context and configurations.
- ``predict```: Handles the prediction logic for the chat model.

Of these methods listed above, the methods ``load_context`` and ``predict`` override the base abstracted implementations of ``ChatModel``. In order to 
define a subclass of ``ChatModel``, you must implement (at a minimum), the ``predict`` method. The ``load_context`` method is only used if you are implementing (as we 
will be below) custom loading logic where a static configuration needs to be loaded for the model object to work, or additional dependent logic needs
to execute in order for the object instantiation to function correctly. 


Example of a custom ChatModel
-----------------------------

In the full example below, we're creating a custom chat agent by subclassing the :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel`. This agent, named ``BasicAgent``, 
takes advantage of several important features that help streamline the development, deployment, and tracking of GenAI applications. By subclassing ``ChatModel``, 
we ensure a consistent interface for handling conversational agents, while also avoiding common pitfalls associated with more general-purpose models.

The implementation below highlights the following key aspects:

- **Tracing**: We leverage MLflow's tracing functionality to track and log critical operations using both the decorator and fluent API context handler approaches. 
    
    - **Decorator API**: This is used to easily trace methods such as `_get_agent_response` and `_call_agent` for automatic span creation.
    - **Fluent API**: Provides fine-grained control over span creation, as shown in the `predict` method for auditing key inputs and outputs during agent interactions.
    - **Tip**: We ensure human-readable span names for easier debugging in the MLflow Trace UI and when fetching logged traces via the client API.

- **Custom Configuration**: 
    
    - **Model Configuration**: By passing custom configurations during model logging (using the `model_config` parameter), we decouple model behavior from 
      hard-coded values. This allows rapid testing of different agent configurations without modifying the source code.
    - **load_context Method**: Ensures that configurations are loaded at runtime, initializing the agent with the necessary settings and preventing runtime 
      failures due to missing configurations.
    - **Tip**: We avoid directly setting undefined instance attributes within `load_context`. Instead, all attributes are initialized with default 
      values in the class constructor to ensure proper loading of our model.

- **Conversation Management**: 
    
    - We implement a multi-step agent interaction pattern using methods like `_get_system_message`, `_get_agent_response`, and `_call_agent`. These 
      methods manage the flow of communication between multiple agents, such as an "oracle" and a "judge" role, each configured with specific instructions
      and parameters.
    - **Static Input/Output Structures**: By adhering to the ``ChatModel``'s required input (`List[ChatMessage]`) and output (`ChatResponse`) formats, 
      we eliminate the complexities associated with converting JSON or tabular data, which is common in more general models like ``PythonModel``.

- **Common Pitfalls Avoided**:
    
    - **Model Validation via Input Examples**: We provide an input example during model logging, allowing MLflow to validate the input interface and catch
      structural issues early, reducing debugging time during deployment.

            }

Now that we have our model defined, the process of logging it has only a single step that is required to be taken before logging: 
we need to define the configuration for our model to be initialized with. This is done by defining our ``model_config`` configuration.

Setting our ``model_config`` values
-----------------------------------

Before logging the model, we need to define the configuration that governs the behavior of our model's agents. This decoupling of configuration from the core logic of the model allows us to easily test and compare different agent behaviors without needing to modify the model implementation. By using a flexible configuration system, we can efficiently experiment with different settings, making it much easier to iterate and fine-tune our model.

Why Decouple Configuration?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the context of Generative AI (GenAI), agent behavior can vary greatly depending on the instruction sets and parameters (such as ``temperature`` or 
``max_tokens``) given to each agent. If we hardcoded these configurations directly into our model's logic, each new test would require changing the 
model's source code, leading to:

- **Inefficiency**: Changing source code for each test slows down the experimentation process.
- **Increased Risk of Errors**: Constantly modifying the source increases the chance of introducing bugs or unintended side effects.
- **Lack of Reproducibility**: Without a clear separation between code and configuration, tracking and reproducing the exact configuration used for 
  a particular result becomes challenging.

By setting these values externally via the ``model_config`` parameter, we make the model flexible and adaptable to different test scenarios. 
This approach also integrates seamlessly with MLflow's evaluation tools, such as :py:func:`mlflow.evaluate`, which allows you to compare model 
outputs across different configurations systematically.

Defining the Model Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration consists of two main sections:

1. **Models**: This section defines agent-specific configurations, such as the ``judge`` and ``oracle`` roles in this example. Each agent has:
   
   - An **endpoint**: Specifies the model type or service being used for this agent.
   - An **instruction**: Defines the role and responsibilities of the agent (e.g., answering questions, evaluating responses).
   - **Temperature and Max Tokens**: Controls the generation variability (``temperature``) and token limit for responses.

2. **General Configuration**: Additional settings for the overall behavior of the model, such as how user responses should be framed for subsequent agents.

.. note:: 
    
    There are two options available for setting a model configuration: directly within the logging code (shown below) or by writing a configuration file 
    in ``yaml`` format to a local location whose path can be specified when defining the ``model_config`` argument during logging. To learn more about 
    how the ``model_config`` parameter is utilized, `see the guide on model_config usage <../../models.html#python-function-model-interfaces>`_.

Here's how we set the configuration for our agents:

.. code-block:: python

   model_config = {
       "models": {
           "judge": {
               "endpoint": "databricks-meta-llama-3-1-405b-instruct",
               "instruction": (
                   "You are an evaluator of answers provided by others. Based on the context of both the question and the answer, "
                   "provide a corrected answer if it is incorrect; otherwise, enhance the answer with additional context and explanation."
               ),
               "temperature": 0.5,
               "max_tokens": 2000,
           },
           "oracle": {
               "endpoint": "databricks-mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
               "instruction": (
                   "You are a knowledgeable source of information that excels at providing detailed, but brief answers to questions. "
                   "Provide an answer to the question based on the information provided."
               ),
               "temperature": 0.9,
               "max_tokens": 5000,
           },
       },
       "configuration": {
           "user_response_instruction": "Can you evaluate and enhance this answer with the provided contextual history?"
       },
   }

Benefits of External Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Flexibility**: The decoupled configuration allows us to easily switch or adjust model behavior without modifying the core logic. For example, we can 
  change the model's instructions or adjust the ``temperature`` to test different levels of creativity in the responses.
  
- **Scalability**: As more agents are added to the system or new roles are introduced, we can extend this configuration without cluttering the model's 
  code. This separation keeps the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

- **Reproducibility and Comparison**: By keeping configuration external, we can log the specific settings used in each run with MLflow. This makes it 
  easier to reproduce results and compare different experiments, ensuring a robust evaluation and adjudication process to select the best performing
  configuration.

With the configuration in place, we're now ready to log the model and run experiments using these settings. By leveraging MLflow's powerful tracking 
and logging features, we'll be able to manage the experiments efficiently and extract valuable insights from the agent's responses.

Defining an Input Example
-------------------------

Before logging our model, it's important to provide an ``input_example`` that demonstrates how to interact with the model. This example serves several key purposes:

- **Validation at Logging Time**: Including an ``input_example`` allows MLflow to execute the ``predict`` method using this example during the logging 
  process. This helps validate that your model can handle the expected input format and catch any issues early.

- **UI Representation**: The ``input_example`` is displayed in the MLflow UI under the model's artifacts. This provides a convenient reference for 
  users to understand the expected input structure when interacting with the deployed model.

By providing an input example, you ensure that your model is tested with real data, increasing confidence that it will behave as expected when deployed.

.. tip::

    When defining your GenAI application using the :py:class:`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel`, a default placeholder input example will be used if none is provided. 
    If you notice an unfamiliar or generic input example in the MLflow UIâ€™s artifact viewer, it's likely the default placeholder assigned by the system. 
    To avoid this, ensure you specify a custom input example when saving your model.


Here's the input example we'll use:

.. code-block:: python

    input_example = {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is a good recipe for baking scones that doesn't require a lot of skill?",
            }
        ]
    }

This example represents a user asking for an easy scone recipe. It aligns with the input structure expected by our ``BasicAgent`` model, which processes a 
list of messages where each message includes a ``role`` and ``content``.

**Benefits of Providing an Input Example:**

- **Execution and Validation**: MLflow will pass this ``input_example`` to the model's ``predict`` method during logging to ensure that it can process 
  the input without errors. Any issues with input handling, such as incorrect data types or missing fields, will be caught at this stage, saving you time 
  debugging later.

- **User Interface Display**: The ``input_example`` will be visible in the MLflow UI within the model artifact view section. This helps users understand 
  the format of input data the model expects, making it easier to interact with the model once it's deployed.

- **Deployment Confidence**: By validating the model with an example input upfront, you gain additional assurance that the model will function correctly 
  in a production environment, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior after deployment.

Including an ``input_example`` is a simple yet powerful step to verify that your model is ready for deployment and will behave as expected when 
receiving input from users.


Logging and Loading our custom Agent
------------------------------------

To log and load the model using MLflow, use:

.. code-block:: python

    with mlflow.start_run():
        model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(
            "model",
            python_model=BasicAgent(),
            model_config=model_config,
            input_example=input_example,
        )

    loaded = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_info.model_uri)

    response = loaded.predict(
        {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "What is the best material to make a baseball bat out of?",
                }
            ]
        }
    )

Conclusion

We demonstrated how to implement a flexible, scalable, and standardized approach to managing the deployment of GenAI applications, enabling you 
to harness the latest advancements in AI, even for libraries and frameworks that are not yet natively supported with a named flavor in MLflow.

By using ``ChatModel`` instead of the more generic ``PythonModel``, you can avoid many of the common pitfalls associated with deploying GenAI by
leveraging the benefits of immutable signature interfaces that are consistent across any of your deployed GenAI interfaces, simplifying the
use of all of your solutions by providing a consistent experience.

Key takeaways from this tutorial include:

- **Tracing and Monitoring**: By integrating tracing directly into the model, you gain valuable insights into the internal workings of your application,
  making debugging and optimization more straightforward. Both the decorator and fluent API approaches offer versatile ways to manage tracing for
  critical operations.

- **Flexible Configuration Management**: Decoupling configurations from your model code ensures that you can rapidly test and iterate without
  modifying source code. This approach not only streamlines experimentation but also enhances reproducibility and scalability as your application evolves.

- **Standardized Input and Output Structures**: Leveraging the static signatures of ``ChatModel`` simplifies the complexities of deploying and
  serving GenAI models. By adhering to established standards, you reduce the friction typically associated with integrating and validating input/output formats.

- **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**: Throughout the implementation, we highlighted best practices to avoid common issues, such as proper handling 
  of secrets, validating input examples, and understanding the nuances of loading context. Following these practices ensures that your model 
  remains secure, robust, and reliable in production environments.

- **Validation and Deployment Readiness**: The importance of validating your model before deployment cannot be overstated. By using tools 
  like :py:func:`mlflow.models.validate_serving_input`, you can catch and resolve potential deployment issues early, saving time and effort 
  during the production deployment process.

As the landscape of Generative AI continues to evolve, building adaptable and standardized models will be crucial to leveraging the exciting
and powerful capabilities that will be unlocked in the months and years ahead. The approach covered in this tutorial equips you with a robust
