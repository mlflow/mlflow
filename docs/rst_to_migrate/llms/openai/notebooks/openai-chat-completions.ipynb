    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up and Validate Environment**: Ensure that all necessary configurations, including the `OPENAI_API_KEY`, are in place for our experiments.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Initialize MLflow Experiment**: Set up an MLflow experiment named \"Text Message Angel\" to track and manage our model's performance and outcomes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Implement Chat Completions with GPT-4**: Utilize the Chat Completions task of GPT-4 to develop an application that can analyze and respond to text messages. This feature of GPT-4 allows for context-aware, conversational AI applications that can understand and generate human-like text responses.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Model Deployment and Prediction**: Deploy our model using MLflow's `pyfunc` implementation and make predictions on a set of sample text messages. This will demonstrate the practical application of our model in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Text Message Angel Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Our application, the Text Message Angel, aims to enhance everyday text communication. It will analyze SMS responses for tone, appropriateness, and relationship impact. The model will categorize responses as either appropriate (\"Good to Go!\") or suggest caution (\"You might want to read that again before pressing send\"). For responses deemed inappropriate, it will also suggest alternative phrasing that maintains a friendly yet witty tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why GPT-4 and MLflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPT-4's Advanced AI**: GPT-4 represents the latest in AI language model development, offering nuanced understanding and response generation capabilities that are ideal for a text-based application like the Text Message Angel.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **MLflow's Seamless Management**: MLflow simplifies the process of tracking experiments, managing different model versions, and deploying AI models. Its integration with GPT-4 allows us to focus on the creative aspect of our application while efficiently handling the technicalities of model management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engaging with the Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress, we encourage you to actively engage with the code and concepts presented. This tutorial is not just about learning the functionalities but also understanding the potential of these technologies when combined creatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's embark on this journey to harness the synergy of MLflow and GPT-4's Chat Completions to enhance communication and interactions in our digital world."

    "### Implementing the Text Message Angel with GPT-4 and Chat Completions\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring the humorous world of misheard lyrics in the introductory tutorial to the `openai` flavor, we now shift our focus to a more sophisticated application involving GPT-4 and the Chat Completions feature. This tutorial introduces the \"Text Message Angel\", an innovative application designed to pre-screen text messages, ensuring they are appropriate and relationship-friendly, especially for those inclined towards sarcasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Up the Text Message Angel Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by setting up a new MLflow experiment titled \"Text Message Angel\". This experiment aims to create a service that analyzes text messages and provides guidance on their appropriateness before sending. The goal is to maintain positive communication while allowing for a playful tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Role of GPT-4 and Chat Completions\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-4 represents a massive leap in capability compared with the previous model we used in the introductory tutorial. It brings enhanced understanding and contextual awareness, making it ideal for interpreting and responding to natural language with a high degree of accuracy and nuance. The Chat Completions feature, specifically, enables a more conversational approach, which is perfect for our text message evaluation scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Crafting the Prompt for Text Message Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of our application is a well-crafted prompt that directs GPT-4 to evaluate text messages based on specific criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content Analysis**: The model determines if a message contains inappropriate elements like humorless sarcasm, passive-aggressive tones, or anything that could harm a relationship.\n",
    "- **Response Categorization**: Based on its analysis, the model categorizes the message as either \"Good to Go!\" or advises to \"read that again before pressing send.\"\n",
    "- **Suggested Corrections**: If a message is deemed inappropriate, the model goes a step further to suggest an alternative version. This corrected message aims to preserve a fun and slightly snarky tone while ensuring it does not harm the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup not only demonstrates the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 in understanding and generating human-like text but also highlights its potential for practical applications in everyday communication scenarios."

    "\n",
    "In this crucial step, we're integrating the advanced GPT-4 model with MLflow for our `Text Message Angel` application. This process involves setting up the model within an MLflow run, logging its configuration, and preparing it for practical use.\n",

    "- **Model Selection**: We specify `gpt-4`, indicating we are utilizing a far more advanced version of OpenAI's models than the previous example.\n",
    "- **Task Specification**: The `openai.chat.completions` task is chosen, aligning with our objective of creating a conversational AI capable of analyzing and responding to text messages.\n",
    "- **Artifact Path**: We define an artifact path where MLflow will store the model-related data.\n",
    "- **Messages**: The `messages` variable, containing our pre-defined prompt and criteria for evaluating text messages, is passed to the model.\n",
    "- **Model Signature**: The signature defines the input-output schema and parameters for our model, such as `max_tokens` and `temperature`. These settings are crucial in controlling how the model generates responses.\n",
