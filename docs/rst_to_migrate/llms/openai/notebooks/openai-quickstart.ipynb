    "### Understanding Prompts and Their Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Prompt?\n",
    "A prompt is a text input given to an AI model, particularly language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, to elicit a specific type of response or output. It guides the model on the expected information or format of the response, setting the stage for the AI's \"thought process\" and steering it toward the desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering involves crafting these inputs to maximize the AI's response effectiveness and accuracy. It's about fine-tuning the language and structure of the prompt to align with the specific task, improving the quality and relevance of the AI's output by reducing ambiguity and directing the model's response towards the intended application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Fun and Simple Example: The Lyrics Corrector\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where a group of friends, who enjoy pop music, often end up in passionate, good-natured debates over misremembered song lyrics. To add more fun to these gatherings, we decide to create a game where an impartial judge – an AI model – adjudicates the correct lyrics after someone proposes and the group attempts to guess the correct song and lyrics from a creative interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why not a Search Engine?\n",
    "Typically, one might turn to an internet search engine to settle these lyrical disputes. However, this method has its drawbacks. Depending on the input, search results can be imprecise, leading to time-consuming searches through various web pages to find the actual lyrics. The authenticity for the results found can be quite questionable due to the nature of the contents of some lyrics. Search engines are not designed with use cases like this in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why an LLM is Perfect for This Task\n",
    "This is where a powerful Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4 becomes a game-changer. LLMs, trained on extensive datasets, are adept at understanding and generating human-like text. Their ability to process natural language inputs and provide relevant, accurate responses makes them ideal for this lyrical challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our Solution: The Lyrics Corrector Prompt\n",
    "To leverage the LLM effectively, we craft a specialized prompt for our Lyrics Corrector application. This prompt is designed with two goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correct Misheard Lyrics**: It instructs the AI to identify the actual lyrics of a song, replacing commonly misheard versions.\n",
    "2. **Add a Humorous Explanation**: More than just correction, the AI also provides a funny explanation for why the misheard lyric is amusingly incorrect, adding an engaging, human-like element to the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "\"Here's a misheard lyric: {lyric}. What's the actual lyric, which song does it come from, which artist performed it, and can you give a funny explanation as to why the misheard version doesn't make sense? Also, rate the creativity of the lyric on a scale of 1 to 3, where 3 is good.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prompt, `{lyric}` is a placeholder for various misheard lyrics. This setup not only showcases the model's ability to process and correct information but also to engage in a more creative, human-like manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this fun and simple example, we explore the potential of LLMs in real-world applications, demonstrating their capacity to enhance everyday experiences with a blend of accuracy and creativity."

This integrates our prompt that defines the characteristics of what we want the nature of the responses to be with the configuration parameters that dictate how MLflow will interact with the OpenAI SDK in order to select the right model with our desired parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MLflow Experiments**: Our first step involves creating or reusing an [MLflow experiment](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/tracking-api.html#organizing-runs-in-experiments) named \"Lyrics Corrector\". Experiments in MLflow are crucial for organizing and tracking different model runs, along with their associated data and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Logging**: Within an [MLflow run](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-runs), we log our model, specifying details such as the model type (`gpt-4o-mini`), the task it's intended for (`openai.completions`), and the custom prompt we've designed. This action ensures that MLflow accurately captures the essence and operational context of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Signature**: Here, we define the input and output schema for our model. We expect a string as input (the misheard lyric) and output a string (the corrected lyric with a humorous explanation). Additional parameters like `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `best_of` are set to control the model's text generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Loading**: Finally, we load the logged model as a generic Python function within MLflow. This makes the model readily usable for predictions and further interactions, allowing us to invoke it like a regular Python function with the specified inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup not only establishes our Lyrics Corrector model but also demonstrates how MLflow can be effectively used to manage complex AI models, ensuring efficient tracking, management, and deployment in practical applications.\n"

       "<p><strong>The actual lyric is \"We built this city on rock and roll\" from the song \"We Built This City\" by Starship. The misheard version is a 3 on the scale, as it completely changes the meaning of the song and adds a humorous twist. The misheard version doesn't make sense because it replaces the iconic rock and roll genre with a food item, sausage rolls. This could be interpreted as a commentary on the current state of the music industry, where popular songs are often criticized for being shallow and lacking substance. The misheard version could also be seen as a nod to the British culture, where sausage rolls are a popular snack. Overall, the misheard lyric adds a playful and unexpected element to the song.</strong></p><br><p><strong>The actual lyric is \"Hold me closer, tiny dancer\" from the song \"Tiny Dancer\" by Elton John. The misheard version is a common one, with many people thinking the lyric is about the actor Tony Danza instead of a dancer. This misheard version would be a 2 on the scale, as it is a humorous and unexpected interpretation of the original lyrics, but still closely resembles the original and the intent of the song. The misheard version doesn't make sense because Tony Danza is not known for his dancing skills, so it would be odd for someone to want to be held closer to him specifically for his dancing abilities. It also changes the meaning of the song, as the original lyrics are about a small and delicate dancer, while the misheard version is about a well-known actor.</strong></p><br><p><strong>The actual lyric is \"Sweet dreams are made of this. Who am I to disagree? I travel the world and the seven seas. Everybody's looking for something.\" It comes from the song \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" by the Eurythmics.\n",
       "\n",
       "The misheard version is a play on words, replacing \"this\" with \"cheese\" and using different types of cheese in place of \"seven seas.\" It doesn't make sense because cheese is not typically associated with dreams or traveling the world. It also changes the meaning of the song from a philosophical exploration of desires and purpose to a silly ode to cheese.\n",
       "\n",
       "I would rate this misheard lyric a 2. It is fairly creative and humorous, but it still closely resembles the original lyrics and doesn't deviate too far from the intent of the song.</strong></p><br><p><strong>The actual lyric is \"Excuse me while I kiss the sky\" from the song \"Purple Haze\" by Jimi Hendrix. The misheard version is a common one, with many people thinking Hendrix was singing about kissing a guy instead of the sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "Funny explanation: Maybe the misheard version came about because Hendrix was known for his wild and unpredictable performances, so people thought he might just randomly kiss a guy on stage. Or maybe they thought he was singing about a romantic moment with a male lover in the sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "Objective rating: 2. While the misheard version is a common one and does have some humor to it, it's not particularly original or unexpected. It's a simple word swap that still somewhat makes sense in the context of the song.</strong></p><br><p><strong>The actual lyric is \"I want to rock and roll all night and party every day\" from the song \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" by Kiss.\n",
       "\n",
       "The misheard lyric, \"I want to rock and roll all night and part of every day,\" doesn't make sense because it implies that the person only wants to rock and roll for a portion of each day, rather than all night and every day. It also changes the meaning of the lyric from wanting to party all day and night to only wanting to party for part of the day.\n",
       "\n",
       "I would rate this misheard lyric a 2. While it does have some humor and changes the meaning of the original lyric, it is still quite similar to the original and doesn't completely change the intent of the song.</strong></p><br><p><strong>The actual lyric is \"There's a bad moon on the rise\" from the song \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. The misheard lyric is a common one, with many people hearing \"There's a bathroom on the right\" instead of the correct lyrics. This misheard version doesn't make sense because it changes the tone and meaning of the song from a warning about a dangerous situation to a mundane reminder about bathroom locations. \n",
       "\n",
       "Objective rating: 2. While the misheard lyric is not particularly creative, it does add a humorous twist to the song and is a common misinterpretation.</strong></p><br><p><strong>The actual lyric is \"I think you'll understand, when I say that somethin', I want to hold your hand\" from the song \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" by The Beatles.\n",
       "\n",
       "The misheard lyric is a 3 on the scale. The original lyric is a sweet and innocent expression of love, while the misheard version turns it into a bizarre and aggressive desire to take someone's land. It's a complete departure from the original meaning and adds a humorous twist to the song. It also plays on the idea of misheard lyrics often being nonsensical and out of context.</strong></p>"
