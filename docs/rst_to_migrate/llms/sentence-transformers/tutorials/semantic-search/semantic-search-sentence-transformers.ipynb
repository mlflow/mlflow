    "- **Model Storage**: Saving the model to a directory, essential for later deployment via MLflow. The choice of `/tmp/search_model` is for tutorial convenience so that your current working directory is not filled with the model files. You can change this to any location of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparing Model Artifacts and Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artifacts Dictionary**: Creating a dictionary with paths to model and corpus file, guiding MLflow to the components that are required to initialize the custom model object.\n",
    "- **Input Example and Test Output**: Defining sample input and output to illustrate the model's expected data formats.\n",
    "- **Model Signature**: Using `infer_signature` for automatic signature generation, encompassing input, output, and operational parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of the Model Signature\n",
    "The signature ensures data consistency between training and deployment, enhancing model usability and reducing error potential. Having a signature specified ensures that type validation occurs at inference time, preventing unexpected behavior with invalid type conversions that could render incorrect or confusing inference results.\n",
