MLflow Tracking Quickstart Notebook
===================================

Welcome to the MLflow Tracking Quickstart! The notebook-based companion to the quickstart guide is tailored to help you quickly 
understand the core features of MLflow Tracking. In just a few minutes, you'll gain hands-on experience with the fundamental aspects 
of MLflow, including:

- Installing MLflow.
- Starting a local MLflow Tracking Server.
- Logging and registering a model with MLflow.
- Loading a logged model for inference using MLflow's `pyfunc` flavor.
- Viewing the experiment results in the MLflow UI.

If you are new to MLflow, we recommend starting with this quickstart to familiarize yourself with the most commonly used
