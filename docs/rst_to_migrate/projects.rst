MLflow Projects
===============

An MLflow Project is a format for packaging data science code in a reusable and reproducible way,
based primarily on conventions. In addition, the Projects component includes an API and command-line
tools for running projects, making it possible to chain together projects into workflows.

Overview
--------

At the core, MLflow Projects are just a convention for organizing and describing your code to let
other data scientists (or automated tools) run it. Each project is simply a directory of files, or
a Git repository, containing your code. MLflow can run some projects based on a convention for
placing files in this directory (for example, a ``conda.yaml`` file is treated as a
`Conda <https://conda.io/docs>`_ environment), but you can describe your project in more detail by
adding a ``MLproject`` file, which is a `YAML <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/>`_ formatted
text file. Each project can specify several properties:

Name
    A human-readable name for the project.

Entry Points
    Commands that can be run within the project, and information about their
    parameters. Most projects contain at least one entry point that you want other users to
    call. Some projects can also contain more than one entry point: for example, you might have a
    single Git repository containing multiple featurization algorithms. You can also call
    any ``.py`` or ``.sh`` file in the project as an entry point. If you list your entry points in
    a ``MLproject`` file, however, you can also specify *parameters* for them, including data
    types and default values.

Environment
    The software environment that should be used to execute project entry points. This includes all
    library dependencies required by the project code. See :ref:`project-environments` for more
    information about the software environments supported by MLflow Projects, including
    :ref:`Conda environments <project-conda-environments>`,
    :ref:`Virtualenv environments <project-virtualenv-environments>`, and
    :ref:`Docker containers <project-docker-container-environments>`.

You can run any project from a Git URI or from a local directory using the ``mlflow run``
command-line tool, or the :py:func:`mlflow.projects.run` Python API. These APIs also allow submitting the
project for remote execution on :ref:`Databricks <databricks_execution>` and
:ref:`Kubernetes <kubernetes_execution>`.

.. important::

    By default, MLflow uses a new, temporary working directory for Git projects.
    This means that you should generally pass any file arguments to MLflow
    project using absolute, not relative, paths. If your project declares its parameters, MLflow
    automatically makes paths absolute for parameters of type ``path``.

Specifying Projects
-------------------

By default, any Git repository or local directory can be treated as an MLflow project; you can
invoke any bash or Python script contained in the directory as a project entry point. The
:ref:`project-directories` section describes how MLflow interprets directories as projects.

To provide additional control over a project's attributes, you can also include an :ref:`MLproject
file <mlproject-file>` in your project's repository or directory.

Finally, MLflow projects allow you to specify the software :ref:`environment <project-environments>`
that is used to execute project entry points.

.. _project-environments:

Project Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MLflow currently supports the following project environments: Virtualenv environment, conda environment, Docker container environment, and system environment.

.. _project-virtualenv-environments:

Virtualenv environment (preferred)
  Virtualenv environments support Python packages available on PyPI. When an MLflow Project
  specifies a Virtualenv environment, MLflow will download the specified version of Python by using
  ``pyenv`` and create an isolated environment that contains the project dependencies using ``virtualenv``,
  activating it as the execution environment prior to running the project code.

  You can specify a Virtualenv environment for your MLflow Project by including a ``python_env`` entry in your
  ``MLproject`` file. For details, see the :ref:`project-directories` and :ref:`mlproject-specify-environment` sections.

.. _project-docker-container-environments:

Docker container environment
  `Docker containers <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`_ allow you to capture
  non-Python dependencies such as Java libraries.

  When you run an MLflow project that specifies a Docker image, MLflow runs your image as is with the parameters
  specified in your MLproject file. In this case you'll need to pre build your images with both environment
  and code to run it. To run the project with a new image that's based on your image and contains the project's
  contents in the ``/mlflow/projects/code`` directory, use the ``--build-image`` flag when running ``mlflow run``.

  Environment variables, such as ``MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI``, are propagated inside the Docker container
  during project execution. Additionally, 
  :ref:`runs and experiments <organizing_runs_in_experiments>` created by the project are saved to the
  tracking server specified by your :ref:`tracking URI <where_runs_are_recorded>`. When running
  against a local tracking URI, MLflow mounts the host system's tracking directory
  (e.g., a local ``mlruns`` directory) inside the container so that metrics, parameters, and
  artifacts logged during project execution are accessible afterwards.

  See `Dockerized Model Training with MLflow
  <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/docker>`_ for an example of an MLflow
  project with a Docker environment.

  To specify a Docker container environment, you *must* add an
  :ref:`MLproject file <mlproject-file>` to your project. For information about specifying
  a Docker container environment in an ``MLproject`` file, see
  :ref:`mlproject-specify-environment`.

.. _project-conda-environments:

Conda environment
  `Conda <https://conda.io/docs>`_ environments support
  both Python packages and native libraries (e.g, CuDNN or Intel MKL). When an MLflow Project
  specifies a Conda environment, it is activated before project code is run.

  .. warning::

      By using conda, you're responsible for adhering to `Anaconda's terms of service <https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en/?name=terms-of-service>`_.

  By default, MLflow uses the system path to find and run the ``conda`` binary. You can use a
  different Conda installation by setting the ``MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME`` environment variable; in this
  case, MLflow attempts to run the binary at ``$MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME/bin/conda``.

  You can specify a Conda environment for your MLflow project by including a ``conda.yaml``
  file in the root of the project directory or by including a ``conda_env`` entry in your
  ``MLproject`` file. For details, see the :ref:`project-directories` and :ref:`mlproject-specify-environment` sections.

  The ``mlflow run`` command supports running a conda environment project as a virtualenv environment project.
  To do this, run ``mlflow run`` with ``--env-manager virtualenv``:

  .. code-block:: bash

      mlflow run /path/to/conda/project --env-manager virtualenv

  .. warning::

      When a conda environment project is executed as a virtualenv environment project,
      conda dependencies will be ignored and only pip dependencies will be installed.

System environment
  You can also run MLflow Projects directly in your current system environment. All of the
  project's dependencies must be installed on your system prior to project execution. The system
  environment is supplied at runtime. It is not part of the MLflow Project's directory contents
  or ``MLproject`` file. For information about using the system environment when running
  a project, see the ``Environment`` parameter description in the :ref:`running-projects` section.

.. _project-directories:

Project Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running an MLflow Project directory or repository that does *not* contain an ``MLproject``
file, MLflow uses the following conventions to determine the project's attributes:

* The project's name is the name of the directory.

* The `Conda environment <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually>`_
  is specified in ``conda.yaml``, if present. If no ``conda.yaml`` file is present, MLflow
  uses a Conda environment containing only Python (specifically, the latest Python available to
  Conda) when running the project.

* Any ``.py`` and ``.sh`` file in the project can be an entry point. MLflow uses Python
  to execute entry points with the ``.py`` extension, and it uses bash to execute entry points with
  the ``.sh`` extension. For more information about specifying project entrypoints at runtime,
  see :ref:`running-projects`.

* By default, entry points do not have any parameters when an ``MLproject`` file is not included.
  Parameters can be supplied at runtime via the ``mlflow run`` CLI or the
  :py:func:`mlflow.projects.run` Python API. Runtime parameters are passed to the entry point on the
  command line using ``--key value`` syntax. For more information about running projects and
  with runtime parameters, see :ref:`running-projects`.

.. _mlproject-file:

MLproject File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can get more control over an MLflow Project by adding an ``MLproject`` file, which is a text
file in YAML syntax, to the project's root directory. The following is an example of an
``MLproject`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: My Project

    python_env: python_env.yaml
    # or
    # conda_env: my_env.yaml
    # or
    # docker_env:
    #    image:  mlflow-docker-example

    entry_points:
      main:
        parameters:
          data_file: path
          regularization: {type: float, default: 0.1}
        command: "python train.py -r {regularization} {data_file}"
      validate:
        parameters:
          data_file: path
        command: "python validate.py {data_file}"

The file can specify a name and :ref:`a Conda or Docker environment
<mlproject-specify-environment>`, as well as more detailed information about each entry point.
Specifically, each entry point defines a :ref:`command to run <mlproject-command-syntax>` and
:ref:`parameters to pass to the command <project_parameters>` (including data types).

.. _mlproject-specify-environment:

Specifying an Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to specify Conda and Docker container environments in an ``MLproject`` file.
``MLproject`` files cannot specify *both* a Conda environment and a Docker environment.

Virtualenv environment
  Include a top-level ``python_env`` entry in the ``MLproject`` file.
  The value of this entry must be a *relative* path to a `python_env` YAML file
  within the MLflow project's directory. The following is an example ``MLProject``
  file with a ``python_env`` definition:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    python_env: files/config/python_env.yaml

  ``python_env`` refers to an environment file located at
  ``<MLFLOW_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>/files/config/python_env.yaml``, where
  ``<MLFLOW_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>`` is the path to the MLflow project's root directory.

  The following is an example of a ``python_env.yaml`` file:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      # Python version required to run the project.
      python: "3.8.15"
      # Dependencies required to build packages. This field is optional.
      build_dependencies:
        - pip
        - setuptools
        - wheel==0.37.1
      # Dependencies required to run the project.
      dependencies:
        - mlflow==2.3
        - scikit-learn==1.0.2

Conda environment
  Include a top-level ``conda_env`` entry in the ``MLproject`` file.
  The value of this entry must be a *relative* path to a `Conda environment YAML file
  <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually>`_
  within the MLflow project's directory. In the following example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    conda_env: files/config/conda_environment.yaml

  ``conda_env`` refers to an environment file located at
  ``<MLFLOW_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>/files/config/conda_environment.yaml``, where
  ``<MLFLOW_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>`` is the path to the MLflow project's root directory.

Docker container environment
  Include a top-level ``docker_env`` entry in the ``MLproject`` file. The value of this entry must be the name
  of a Docker image that is accessible on the system executing the project; this image name
  may include a registry path and tags. Here are a couple of examples.

  .. rubric:: Example 1: Image without a registry path

  .. code-block:: yaml

    docker_env:
      image: mlflow-docker-example-environment

  In this example, ``docker_env`` refers to the Docker image with name
  ``mlflow-docker-example-environment`` and default tag ``latest``. Because no registry path is
  specified, Docker searches for this image on the system that runs the MLflow project. If the
  image is not found, Docker attempts to pull it from `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_.

  .. rubric:: Example 2: Mounting volumes and specifying environment variables

  You can also specify local volumes to mount in the docker image (as you normally would with Docker's `-v` option), and additional environment variables (as per Docker's `-e` option). Environment variables can either be copied from the host system's environment variables, or specified as new variables for the Docker environment. The `environment` field should be a list. Elements in this list can either be lists of two strings (for defining a new variable) or single strings (for copying variables from the host system). For example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    docker_env:
      image: mlflow-docker-example-environment
      volumes: ["/local/path:/container/mount/path"]
      environment: [["NEW_ENV_VAR", "new_var_value"], "VAR_TO_COPY_FROM_HOST_ENVIRONMENT"]

  In this example our docker container will have one additional local volume mounted, and two additional environment variables: one newly-defined, and one copied from the host system.

  .. rubric:: Example 3: Image in a remote registry

  .. code-block:: yaml

    docker_env:
      image: 012345678910.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mlflow-docker-example-environment:7.0

  In this example, ``docker_env`` refers to the Docker image with name
  ``mlflow-docker-example-environment`` and tag ``7.0`` in the Docker registry with path
  ``012345678910.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com``, which corresponds to an
  `Amazon ECR registry <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html>`_.
  When the MLflow project is run, Docker attempts to pull the image from the specified registry.
  The system executing the MLflow project must have credentials to pull this image from  the specified registry.

  .. rubric:: Example 4: Build a new image

  .. code-block:: yaml

    docker_env:
      image: python:3.8

  .. code-block:: bash

    mlflow run ... --build-image

  To build a new image that's based on the specified image and files contained in
  the project directory, use the ``--build-image`` argument. In the above example, the image
  ``python:3.8`` is pulled from Docker Hub if it's not present locally, and a new image is built
  based on it. The project is executed in a container created from this image.

.. _mlproject-command-syntax:

Command Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When specifying an entry point in an ``MLproject`` file, the command can be any string in Python
`format string syntax <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings>`_.
All of the parameters declared in the entry point's ``parameters`` field are passed into this
string for substitution. If you call the project with additional parameters *not* listed in the
``parameters`` field, MLflow passes them using ``--key value`` syntax, so you can use the
``MLproject`` file to declare types and defaults for just a subset of your parameters.

Before substituting parameters in the command, MLflow escapes them using the Python
`shlex.quote <https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote>`_ function, so you don't
need to worry about adding quotes inside your command field.

.. _project_parameters:

Specifying Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MLflow allows specifying a data type and default value for each parameter. You can specify just the
data type by writing:

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameter_name: data_type

in your YAML file, or add a default value as well using one of the following syntaxes (which are
equivalent in YAML):

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameter_name: {type: data_type, default: value}  # Short syntax

    parameter_name:     # Long syntax
      type: data_type
      default: value

MLflow supports four parameter types, some of which it treats specially (for example, downloading
data to local files). Any undeclared parameters are treated as ``string``. The parameter types are:

string
    A text string.

float
    A real number. MLflow validates that the parameter is a number.

path
    A path on the local file system. MLflow converts any relative ``path`` parameters to absolute
    paths. MLflow also downloads any paths passed as distributed storage URIs
    (``s3://``, ``dbfs://``, ``gs://``, etc.) to local files. Use this type for programs that can only read local
    files.

uri
    A URI for data either in a local or distributed storage system. MLflow converts
    relative paths to absolute paths, as in the ``path`` type. Use this type for programs
    that know how to read from distributed storage (e.g., programs that use Spark).

.. _running-projects:

Running Projects
----------------

MLflow provides two ways to run projects: the ``mlflow run`` :ref:`command-line tool <cli>`, or
the :py:func:`mlflow.projects.run` Python API. Both tools take the following parameters:

Project URI
    A directory on the local file system or a Git repository path,
    specified as a URI of the form ``https://<repo>`` (to use HTTPS) or ``user@host:path``
    (to use Git over SSH). To run against an MLproject file located in a subdirectory of the project,
    add a '#' to the end of the URI argument, followed by the relative path from the project's root directory
    to the subdirectory containing the desired project.

Project Version
    For Git-based projects, the commit hash or branch name in the Git repository.

Entry Point
    The name of the entry point, which defaults to ``main``. You can use any
    entry point named in the ``MLproject`` file, or any ``.py`` or ``.sh`` file in the project,
    given as a path from the project root (for example, ``src/test.py``).

Parameters
    Key-value parameters. Any parameters with
    :ref:`declared types <project_parameters>` are validated and transformed if needed.

Deployment Mode
    - Both the command-line and API let you :ref:`launch projects remotely <databricks_execution>`
      in a `Databricks <https://databricks.com>`_ environment. This includes setting cluster
      parameters such as a VM type. Of course, you can also run projects on any other computing
      infrastructure of your choice using the local version of the ``mlflow run`` command (for
      example, submit a script that does ``mlflow run`` to a standard job queueing system).

    - You can also launch projects remotely on `Kubernetes <https://Kubernetes.io/>`_ clusters
      using the ``mlflow run`` CLI (see :ref:`kubernetes_execution`).

Environment
    By default, MLflow Projects are run in the environment specified by the project directory
    or the ``MLproject`` file (see :ref:`Specifying Project Environments <project-environments>`).
    You can ignore a project's specified environment and run the project in the current
    system environment by supplying the ``--env-manager=local`` flag, but this can lead to
    unexpected results if there are dependency mismatches between the project environment and
    the current system environment.

For example, the tutorial creates and publishes an MLflow Project that trains a linear model. The
project is also published on GitHub at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example. To run
this project:

.. code-block:: bash

    mlflow run git@github.com:mlflow/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=0.5

There are also additional options for disabling the creation of a Conda environment, which can be
useful if you quickly want to test a project in your existing shell environment.

.. _databricks_execution:

Run an MLflow Project on Databricks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run MLflow Projects remotely on Databricks. To use this feature, you must have an enterprise
Databricks account (Community Edition is not supported) and you must have set up the
`Databricks CLI <https://github.com/databricks/databricks-cli>`_. Find detailed instructions
in the Databricks docs (`Azure Databricks <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/applications/mlflow/projects#run-an-mlflow-project>`_,
`Databricks on AWS <https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/projects.html>`_).

.. _kubernetes_execution:

Run an MLflow Project on Kubernetes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run MLflow Projects with :ref:`Docker environments <project-docker-container-environments>`
on Kubernetes. The following sections provide an overview of the feature, including a simple
Project execution guide with examples.


To see this feature in action, you can also refer to the
`Docker example <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/docker>`_, which includes
the required Kubernetes backend configuration (``kubernetes_backend.json``) and `Kubernetes Job Spec
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#writing-a-job-spec>`_
(``kubernetes_job_template.yaml``) files.

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you run an MLflow Project on Kubernetes, MLflow constructs a new Docker image
containing the Project's contents; this image inherits from the Project's
:ref:`Docker environment <project-docker-container-environments>`. MLflow then pushes the new
Project image to your specified Docker registry and starts a
`Kubernetes Job <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/>`_
on your specified Kubernetes cluster. This Kubernetes Job downloads the Project image and starts
a corresponding Docker container. Finally, the container invokes your Project's
:ref:`entry point <running-projects>`, logging parameters, tags, metrics, and artifacts to your
:ref:`MLflow tracking server <tracking_server>`.

Execution guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run your MLflow Project on Kubernetes by following these steps:

1. Add a Docker environment to your MLflow Project, if one does not already exist. For
   reference, see :ref:`mlproject-specify-environment`.

2. Create a backend configuration JSON file with the following entries:

   - ``kube-context``
     The `Kubernetes context
     <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#context>`_
     where MLflow will run the job. If not provided, MLflow will use the current context.
     If no context is available, MLflow will assume it is running in a Kubernetes cluster
     and it will use the Kubernetes service account running the current pod ('in-cluster' configuration).
   - ``repository-uri``
     The URI of the docker repository where the Project execution Docker image will be uploaded
     (pushed). Your Kubernetes cluster must have access to this repository in order to run your
     MLflow Project.
   - ``kube-job-template-path``
     The path to a YAML configuration file for your Kubernetes Job - a `Kubernetes Job Spec
     <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#writing-a-job-spec>`_.
     MLflow reads the Job Spec and replaces certain fields to facilitate job execution and
     monitoring; MLflow does not modify the original template file. For more information about
     writing Kubernetes Job Spec templates for use with MLflow, see the
     :ref:`kubernetes_execution_job_templates` section.

  .. rubric:: Example Kubernetes backend configuration

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "kube-context": "docker-for-desktop",
      "repository-uri": "username/mlflow-kubernetes-example",
      "kube-job-template-path": "/Users/username/path/to/kubernetes_job_template.yaml"
    }

3. If necessary, obtain credentials to access your Project's Docker and Kubernetes resources, including:

   - The :ref:`Docker environment image <mlproject-specify-environment>` specified in the MLproject
     file.
   - The Docker repository referenced by ``repository-uri`` in your backend configuration file.
   - The `Kubernetes context
     <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#context>`_
     referenced by ``kube-context`` in your backend configuration file.

   MLflow expects these resources to be accessible via the
   `docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/>`_ and
   `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/>`_ CLIs before running the
   Project.

4. Run the Project using the MLflow Projects CLI or :py:func:`Python API <mlflow.projects.run>`,
   specifying your Project URI and the path to your backend configuration file. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

    mlflow run <project_uri> --backend kubernetes --backend-config examples/docker/kubernetes_config.json

   where ``<project_uri>`` is a Git repository URI or a folder.

.. _kubernetes_execution_job_templates:

Job Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MLflow executes Projects on Kubernetes by creating `Kubernetes Job resources
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/>`_.
MLflow creates a Kubernetes Job for an MLflow Project by reading a user-specified
`Job Spec
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#writing-a-job-spec>`_.
When MLflow reads a Job Spec, it formats the following fields:

- ``metadata.name`` Replaced with a string containing the name of the MLflow Project and the time
  of Project execution
- ``spec.template.spec.container[0].name`` Replaced with the name of the MLflow Project
- ``spec.template.spec.container[0].image`` Replaced with the URI of the Docker image created during
  Project execution. This URI includes the Docker image's digest hash.
- ``spec.template.spec.container[0].command`` Replaced with the Project entry point command
  specified when executing the MLflow Project.

The following example shows a simple Kubernetes Job Spec that is compatible with MLflow Project
execution. Replaced fields are indicated using bracketed text.

.. rubric:: Example Kubernetes Job Spec

.. code-block:: yaml

  apiVersion: batch/v1
  kind: Job
  metadata:
    name: "{replaced with MLflow Project name}"
    namespace: mlflow
  spec:
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
    backoffLimit: 0
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: "{replaced with MLflow Project name}"
          image: "{replaced with URI of Docker image created during Project execution}"
          command: ["{replaced with MLflow Project entry point command}"]
          env: ["{appended with MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI, MLFLOW_RUN_ID and MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID}"]
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 512Mi
            requests:
              memory: 256Mi
        restartPolicy: Never

The ``container.name``, ``container.image``, and ``container.command`` fields are only replaced for
the *first* container defined in the Job Spec. Further, the ``MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI``, ``MLFLOW_RUN_ID``
and ``MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID`` are appended to ``container.env``. Use ``KUBE_MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`` to
pass a different tracking URI to the job container from the standard ``MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI``. All
subsequent container definitions are applied without modification.

Iterating Quickly
-----------------

If you want to rapidly develop a project, we recommend creating an ``MLproject`` file with your
main program specified as the ``main`` entry point, and running it with ``mlflow run .``.
To avoid having to write parameters repeatedly, you can add default parameters in your ``MLproject`` file.

Building Multistep Workflows
-----------------------------

The :py:func:`mlflow.projects.run` API, combined with :py:mod:`mlflow.client`, makes it possible to build
multi-step workflows with separate projects (or entry points in the same project) as the individual
steps. Each call to :py:func:`mlflow.projects.run` returns a run object, that you can use with
:py:mod:`mlflow.client` to determine when the run has ended and get its output artifacts. These artifacts
can then be passed into another step that takes ``path`` or ``uri`` parameters. You can coordinate
all of the workflow in a single Python program that looks at the results of each step and decides
what to submit next using custom code. Some example use cases for multi-step workflows include:

Modularizing Your Data Science Code
  Different users can publish reusable steps for data featurization, training, validation, and so on, that other users or team can run in their workflows. Because MLflow supports Git versioning, another team can lock their workflow to a specific version of a project, or upgrade to a new one on their own schedule.

Hyperparameter Tuning
  Using :py:func:`mlflow.projects.run` you can launch multiple runs in parallel either on the local machine or on a cloud platform like Databricks. Your driver program can then inspect the metrics from each run in real time to cancel runs, launch new ones, or select the best performing run on a target metric.

Cross-validation
  Sometimes you want to run the same training code on different random splits of training and validation data. With MLflow Projects, you can package the project in a way that allows this, for example, by taking a random seed for the train/validation split as a parameter, or by calling another project first that can split the input data.

For an example of how to construct such a multistep workflow, see the MLflow `Multistep Workflow Example project <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/multistep_workflow>`_.
