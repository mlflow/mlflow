## Prerequisites for running the examples

1. Install MLflow and required packages

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade mlflow
   ```

2. Create an MLflow experiment by following the [setup your environment quickstart](/genai/getting-started/connect-environment/).

3. (Optional, if using OpenAI models) Use the native OpenAI SDK to connect to OpenAI-hosted models. Select a model from the [available OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).

   ```python
   import mlflow
   import os
   import openai

   # Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment
   # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_API_KEY>" # Uncomment and set if not globally configured

   # Enable auto-tracing for OpenAI
   mlflow.openai.autolog()

   # Create an OpenAI client
   client = openai.OpenAI()

   # Select an LLM
   model_name = "gpt-4o-mini"
   ```
