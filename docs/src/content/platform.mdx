MLflow can be used in a variety of environments, including your local environment, on-premises clusters, cloud platforms, and managed services. Being an open-source platform, MLflow is **vendor-neutral**; no matter where you are doing machine learning, you have access to the MLflow's core capabilities sets such as tracking, evaluation, observability, and more.
