## Select the LLM that powers the judge

You can change the judge model by using the `model` argument in the judge definition. The model must be specified in the format `<provider>:/<model-name>`, where `<provider>` is a LiteLLM-compatible model provider.

For a list of supported models, see [selecting judge models](/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/custom-judges/#selecting-judge-models).
