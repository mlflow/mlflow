# Resolve PR Review Comments

Automatically fetch and address PR review comments. This command examines review feedback and makes necessary code changes to resolve the issues.

## Usage

```
/resolve <pr_url> [prompt]
```

## Arguments

- `pr_url` (required): The GitHub PR URL (e.g., `https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12345`)
- `prompt` (optional): Additional context or filtering instructions for resolving comments

## Examples

```
/resolve https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12345
/resolve https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12345 Focus on type hint issues only
/resolve https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12345 Skip comments from automated bots
/resolve https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12345 Only resolve comments in mlflow/tracking/ directory
```

## Instructions

1. Parse the PR URL to extract owner, repo, and PR number
2. Fetch all review comments using `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method="get_review_comments"`
3. **Filter out resolved comments**: Skip any comments that have already been marked as resolved
4. Apply any additional filtering from the optional prompt (e.g., focus on specific files or issue types)
5. For each unresolved review comment:
   - **Prioritize ```suggestion blocks**: Apply them exactly as provided by the reviewer
   - Read the file and surrounding code for context
   - Make minimal, precise changes to address the feedback
   - Follow project style guides (Python: see `dev/guides/python.md`)
6. After all changes, create a git commit (details in next section)

## Committing Changes

1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Create a DCO-signed commit: `git commit -s -m "<message>"`
   - Include footer: `ðŸ¤– Generated by Claude /resolve command`
3. Handle any pre-commit hook failures (they may auto-fix formatting)
4. **DO NOT push** - Workflow handles pushing
