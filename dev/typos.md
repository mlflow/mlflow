## Typos

A quick guide on how to use [`typos`](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) to find, fix, and ignore typos.

## Installation

```sh
# Replace `<version>` with the version installed in `dev/install-typos.sh`.
brew install typos-cli@<version>

# See https://github.com/crate-ci/typos?tab=readme-ov-file#install for other installation methods
```

## Finding typos

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files typos
```

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos either manually or by running the following command:

```sh
typos --write-changes [PATH]
```

## Ignoring false positives

There are three ways to ignore false positives:

### Option 1: Ignore a line containing false positives

```python
typo  # spellchecker: disable-line
```

### Option 2: Ignore a block containing false positives

```python
# spellchecker: off
typo
# spellchecker: on
```

### Option 3: Extend the ignore list in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml)

```toml
# pyproject.toml

[tool.typos.default]
extend-ignore-re = [
  ...,
  "typo",
]
```

## Found a typo, but `typos` doesn't recognize it?

`typos` only recognizes typos that are in its dictionary.
If you find a typo that `typos` doesn't recognize,
you can extend the `extend-words` list in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml).

```toml
# pyproject.toml

[tool.typos.default.extend-words]
...
mflow = "mlflow"
```
