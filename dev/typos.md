# Typos

A quick guide on how to use [`typos`](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) to find, fix, and ignore typos.

## Installation

```sh
# Replace `<version>` with the version installed in `dev/install-typos.sh`.
brew install typos-cli@<version>

```

See https://github.com/crate-ci/typos?tab=readme-ov-file#install for other installation methods.

## Finding typos

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files typos
```

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos either manually or by running the following command:

```sh
typos --write-changes [PATH]
```

## Ignoring false positives

There are two ways to ignore false positives:

### Option 1: Ignore a line/block containing false positives

This option is preferred if the false positive is a one-off.

```python
# Ignore a line containing a typo:

"<false_positive>"  # spellchecker: disable-line

# Ignore a block containing typos:

# spellchecker: off
"<false_positive>"
"<another_false_positive>"
# spellchecker: on
```

### Option 2: Extend the ignore list in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml)

This option is preferred if the false positive is common across multiple files/lines.

```toml
# pyproject.toml

[tool.typos.default]
extend-ignore-re = [
  ...,
  "false_positive",
]
```

## Found a typo, but `typos` doesn't recognize it?

`typos` only recognizes typos that are in its dictionary.
If you find a typo that `typos` doesn't recognize,
you can extend the `extend-words` list in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml).

```toml
# pyproject.toml

[tool.typos.default.extend-words]
...
mflow = "mlflow"
```
