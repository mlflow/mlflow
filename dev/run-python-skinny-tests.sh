# Executes a subset of mlflow tests that is supported with fewer dependencies than the core mlflow package.
# Tests include most client interactions and compatibility points with the mlflow plugins around tracking, projects, models, deployments, and the cli.

# The SQL alchemy store's dependencies are added for a base client/store that can be tested against.
# A different example client/store with a minimal dependency footprint could also work for this purpose.

# After verifying skinny client does not include store specific requirements,
# we are installing sqlalchemy store requirements as our example store for the test suite.
# SQL Alchemy serves as a simple, fully featured option to test skinny client store scenarios.
python -m pip install sqlalchemy alembic

# Given the example store does not delete dependencies, we verify non store related dependencies
# after the example store setup. This verifies both the example store and skinny client do not add
# unintended libraries.
