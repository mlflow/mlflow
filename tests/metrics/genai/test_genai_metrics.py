It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big data and machine learning solutions. MLflow is designed to address the challenges that data scientists and machine learning engineers face when developing, training, and deploying machine learning models.\n\nExample score: 4\nExample justification: The definition effectively explains what MLflow is its purpose, and its developer.
