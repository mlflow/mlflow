# Adding `examples` unit tests to `pytest` test suite

Two types of test runs for code in `examples` directory are supported:

- Examples run by `mlflow run`
- Examples run by another command, such as the `python` interpreter

Each of these types of runs are implemented using `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator. Adding a new
example to test involves updating the decorator list as described below.

For purpose of discussion, `new_example_dir` designates the
directory the example code is found, i.e., it is located in `examples/new_example_dir`.

## Examples that utilize `mlflow run` construct

The `@pytest.mark.mark.parametrize` decorator for `def test_mlflow_run_example(directory, params):`
is updated.

If the example is executed by `cd examples/new_example_dir && mlflow run . -P param1=99 -P param2=3`, then
this `tuple` is added to the decorator list

```
("new_example_dir", ["-P", "param1=123", "-P", "param2=99"])
```

as shown below

```
@pytest.mark.parametrize(("directory", "params"), [
    ("sklearn_elasticnet_wine", ["-P", "alpha=0.5"]),
    (os.path.join("sklearn_elasticnet_diabetes", "linux"), []),
    ("new_example_dir", ["-P", "param1=123", "-P", "param2=99"]),
])
def test_mlflow_run_example(directory, params):
```

The `tuple` for an example requiring no parameters is simply:

```
("new_example_dir", []),
```

## Examples that are executed with another command

For an example that is not run by `mlflow run`, the list in
`@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator for `test_command_example(tmpdir, directory, command):` is updated.

Examples invoked by `cd examples/new_example_dir && python train.py` require this tuple added
to the decorator's list

```
("new_example_dir", ["python", "train.py"]),
```

as shown below

```
@pytest.mark.parametrize(("directory", "command"), [
    ('sklearn_logistic_regression', ['python', 'train.py']),
    ('h2o', ['python', 'random_forest.py']),
    ('quickstart', ['python', 'mlflow_tracking.py']),
    ("new_example_dir", ["python", "train.py"]),
])
def test_command_example(tmpdir, directory, command):
```

If the example requires arguments to run, i.e., `python train.py arg1 arg2`, then the
tuple would look like this

```
('new_example_dir', ['python', 'train.py', 'arg1', 'arg2'])
```
