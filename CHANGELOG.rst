Changelog
=========

0.4.1 (2018-08-02)
------------------

Breaking changes: None

Features:

- [Projects] MLflow will use the conda installation directory given by the $MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME
  if specified (e.g. running conda commands by invoking "$MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME/bin/conda"), defaulting
  to running "conda" otherwise. (#231, @smurching)
- [UI] Show GitHub links in the UI for projects run from http(s):// GitHub URLs (#235, @smurching)

Bug fixes:

- Fix GCSArtifactRepository issue when calling list_artifacts on a path containing nested directories (#233, @jakeret)
- Fix Spark model support when saving models to DBFS (#180, @tomasatdatabricks)
- Add missing mlflow.version import to sagemaker module (#229, @dbczumar)
- Validate metric, parameter and run IDs in file store and Python client (#224, @mateiz)
- Validate that the tracking URI is a remote URI for Databricks project runs (#234, @smurching)
- Fix bug where we'd fetch git projects at SSH URIs into a local directory with the same name as
  the URI, instead of into a temporary directory (#236, @smurching)



0.4.0 (2018-08-01)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- [Projects] Removed the ``use_temp_cwd`` argument to ``mlflow.projects.run()``
  (``--new-dir`` flag in the ``mlflow run`` CLI). Runs of local projects now use the local project
  directory as their working directory. Git projects are still fetched into temporary directories
  (#215, @smurching)
- [Tracking] GCS artifact storage is now a pluggable dependency (no longer installed by default). 
  To enable GCS support, install ``google-cloud-storage`` on both the client and tracking server via pip.
  (#202, @smurching)
- [Tracking] Clients running MLflow 0.4.0 and above require a server running MLflow 0.4.0
  or above, due to a fix that ensures clients no longer double-serialize JSON into strings when
  sending data to the server (#200, @aarondav). However, the MLflow 0.4.0 server remains
  backwards-compatible with older clients (#216, @aarondav)


Features:

- [Examples] Add a more advanced tracking example: using MLflow with PyTorch and TensorBoard (#203)
- [Models] H2O model support (#170, @ToonKBC)
- [Projects] Support for running projects in subdirectories of Git repos (#153, @juntai-zheng)
- [SageMaker] Support for specifying a compute specification when deploying to SageMaker (#185, @dbczumar)
- [Server] Added --static-prefix option to serve UI from a specified prefix to MLflow UI and server (#116, @andrewmchen)
- [Tracking] Azure blob storage support for artifacts (#206, @mateiz)
- [Tracking] Add support for Databricks-backed RestStore (#200, @aarondav)
- [UI] Enable productionizing frontend by adding CSRF support (#199, @aarondav)
- [UI] Update metric and parameter filters to let users control column order (#186, @mateiz)

Bug fixes:

- Fixed incompatible file structure returned by GCSArtifactRepository (#173, @jakeret)
- Fixed metric values going out of order on x axis (#204, @mateiz)
- Fixed occasional hanging behavior when using the projects.run API (#193, @smurching)

- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @aarondav, @andrewmchen, @arinto, @jakeret, @mateiz, @smurching, @stbof


0.3.0 (2018-07-18)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- [MLflow Server] Renamed ``--artifact-root`` parameter to ``--default-artifact-root`` in ``mlflow server`` to better reflect its purpose (#165, @aarondav)

Features:

- Spark MLlib integration: we now support logging SparkML Models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs (#72, @tomasatdatabricks)
- Google Cloud Storage is now supported as an artifact storage root (#152, @bnekolny)
- Support asychronous/parallel execution of MLflow runs (#82, @smurching)
- [SageMaker] Support for deleting, updating applications deployed via SageMaker (#145, @dbczumar)
- [SageMaker] Pushing the MLflow SageMaker container now includes the MLflow version that it was published with (#124, @sueann)
- [SageMaker] Simplify parameters to SageMaker deploy by providing sane defaults (#126, @sueann)
- [UI] One-element metrics are now displayed as a bar char (#118, @cryptexis)

Bug fixes:

- Require gitpython>=2.1.0 (#98, @aarondav)
- Fixed TensorFlow model loading so that columns match the output names of the exported model (#94, @smurching)
- Fix SparkUDF when number of columns >= 10 (#97, @aarondav)
- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @emres, @dmatrix, @stbof, @gsganden, @dennyglee, @anabranch, @mikehuston, @andrewmchen, @juntai-zheng

0.2.1 (2018-06-28)
------------------

This is a patch release fixing some smaller issues after the 0.2.0 release.

- Switch protobuf implementation to C, fixing a bug related to tensorflow/mlflow import ordering (issues #33 and #77, PR #74, @andrewmchen)
- Enable running mlflow server without git binary installed (#90, @aarondav)
- Fix Spark UDF support when running on multi-node clusters (#92, @aarondav)

0.2.0 (2018-06-27)
------------------

- Added ``mlflow server`` to provide a remote tracking server. This is akin to ``mlflow ui`` with new options:

  - ``--host`` to allow binding to any ports (#27, @mdagost)
  - ``--artifact-root`` to allow storing artifacts at a remote location, S3 only right now (#78, @mateiz)
  - Server now runs behind gunicorn to allow concurrent requests to be made (#61, @mateiz)

- Tensorflow integration: we now support logging Tensorflow Models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs (#28, @juntai-zheng)
- Added ``experiments.list_experiments`` as part of experiments API (#37, @mparkhe)
- Improved support for unicode strings (#79, @smurching)
- Diabetes progression example dataset and training code (#56, @dennyglee)
- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @Jeffwan, @yupbank, @ndjido, @xueyumusic, @manugarri, @tomasatdatabricks, @stbof, @andyk, @andrewmchen, @jakeret, @0wu, @aarondav

0.1.0 (2018-06-05)
------------------

- Initial version of mlflow.
