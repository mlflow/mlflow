# This file is used by tests (e.g., tests/projects/utils.py:docker_example_base_image)
# to exclude unnecessary files when copying the MLflow source tree for Docker builds.
# Without this file, Docker images built during testing would be extremely large and
# could cause disk space issues.
#
# NOTE: This file is also parsed by mlflow/utils/file_utils.py:_docker_ignore() using
# fnmatch, which does NOT support Docker's ** recursive glob syntax.
# Both root-level and recursive patterns are needed for full compatibility.
