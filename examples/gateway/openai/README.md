## Example endpoint configuration for OpenAI

To view an example of OpenAI endpoint configurations, see [the configuration example](config.yaml) YAML file for OpenAI.

This configuration shows all 3 supported endpoint types: chat, completions, and embeddings.

## Setting the OpenAI API Key

An OpenAI API key is required for the configuration. If you haven't already, obtain an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

With the key, export it to your environment variables. Replace the '...' with your actual API key:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```
