What is the purpose of registering a model with the Model Registry?,"The purpose of registering a model with the Model Registry is to have a unique name for the model, keep track of different versions of the model, store associated transitional stages, maintain model lineage, and store other metadata. By registering a model, you can easily refer to it using a model URI or the model registry API, making it convenient for deployment and updating of models in production workloads.","logged, this model can then be registered with the Model Registry. Registered ModelAn MLflow Model can be registered with the Model Registry. A registered model has a unique name, contains versions, associated transitional stages, model lineage, and other metadata. Model VersionEach registered model can have one or many versions. When a new model is added to the Model Registry, it is added as version 1. Each new model registered to the same model name increments the version number. Model AliasModel aliases allow you to assign a mutable, named reference to a particular version of a registered model. By assigning an alias to a specific model version, you can use the alias to refer that model version via a model URI or the model registry API. For example, you can create an alias named champion that points to version 1 of a model named MyModel. You can then refer to version 1 of MyModel by using the URI models:/MyModel@champion. Aliases are especially useful for deploying models. For example, you could assign a champion alias to the model version intended for production traffic and target this alias in production workloads. You can then update the model serving production traffic by reassigning the champion alias to a different model version. TagsTags are key-value pairs that you associate with registered models and model versions, allowing you to label and categorize them by function or status. For example, you could apply a tag with key ""task"" and value ""question-answering""",1,model-registry.html
What can you do with registered models and model versions?,"With registered models and model versions, you can label and categorize them by function or status. For example, you can apply tags to registered models to indicate their intended tasks, such as question-answering. At the model version level, you can tag versions undergoing pre-deployment validation or those cleared for deployment. Additionally, you can annotate the top-level model and each version individually using Markdown, providing descriptions and relevant information about the algorithm, dataset, or methodology.","associate with registered models and model versions, allowing you to label and categorize them by function or status. For example, you could apply a tag with key ""task"" and value ""question-answering"" (displayed in the UI as task:question-answering) to registered models intended for question answering tasks. At the model version level, you could tag versions undergoing pre-deployment validation with validation_status:pending and those cleared for deployment with validation_status:approved. Annotations and DescriptionsYou can annotate the top-level model and each version individually using Markdown, including description and any relevant information useful for the team such as algorithm descriptions, dataset employed or methodology. Model StageEach distinct model version can be assigned one stage at any given time. MLflow provides predefined stages for common use-cases such as Staging, Production or Archived. You can transition a model version from one stage to another stage. Model Registry Workflows If running your own MLflow server, you must use a database-backed backend store in order to access the model registry via the UI or API. See here for more information. Before you can add a model to the Model Registry, you must log it using the log_model methods of the corresponding model flavors. Once a model has been logged, you can add, modify, update, or delete the model in the Model Registry through the UI or the API.

UI Workflow This section demonstrates how to use the MLflow Model Registry UI to manage your MLflow models. Register a Model Follow the steps below to register your MLflow model in the Model Registry. Open the details page for the MLflow Run containing the logged MLflow model you'd like to register. Select the model folder containing the intended MLflow model in the Artifacts section. Click the Register Model button, which will trigger a form to pop up. In the Model dropdown menu on the form, you can either select "Create New Model", which creates a new registered model with your MLflow model as its initial version, or select an existing registered model, which registers your model under it as a new version. The screenshot below demonstrates registering the MLflow model to a new registered model named ""iris_model_testing"". Find Registered Models After you've registered your models in the Model Registry, you can navigate to them in the following ways. Navigate to the Registered Models page, which links to your registered models and correponding model versions. Go to the Artifacts section of your MLflow Runs details page, click the model folder, and then click the model version at the top right to view the version created from that model.

API Workflow An alternative way to interact with Model Registry is using the MLflow model flavor or MLflow Client Tracking API interface. In particular, you can register a model during an MLflow experiment run or after all your experiment runs. Adding an MLflow Model to the Model Registry There are three programmatic ways to add a model to the registry. First, you can use the mlflow.<model_flavor>.log_model() method.

These files can then be used to reinstall dependencies using conda or virtualenv with pip. Note Anaconda Inc. updated their terms of service for anaconda.org channels. Based on the new terms of service you may require a commercial license if you rely on Anaconda's packaging and distribution. See Anaconda Commercial Edition FAQ for more information. Your use of any Anaconda channels is governed by their terms of service. MLflow models logged before v1.18 were by default logged with the conda defaults channel (https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/) as a dependency. Because of this license change, MLflow has stopped the use of the defaults channel for models logged using MLflow v1.18 and above. The default channel logged is now conda-forge, which points at the community managed https://conda-forge.org/. If you logged a model before MLflow v1.18 without excluding the defaults channel from the conda environment for the model, that model may have a dependency on the defaults channel that you may not have intended. To manually confirm whether a model has this dependency, you can examine channel value in the conda.yaml file that is packaged with the logged model. For example, a model's conda.yaml with a defaults channel dependency may look like this: name: mlflow-env channels: - defaults dependencies: - python=3.8.8 - pip - pip: - mlflow==2.3 - scikit-learn==0.23.2 - cloudpickle==1.6.0 If you would like to change the channel used in a",3,models.html

What is the API used to set signatures on models?,The API used to set signatures on models is the set_signature() API.,"a logged or saved model, use the set_signature() API (see the How to set signatures on models section for more details). Model Signature Types A model signature consists on inputs and outputs schemas, each of which can be either column-based or tensor-based. Column-based schemas are a sequence of (optionally) named columns with type specified as one of the MLflow data types. Tensor-based schemas are a sequence of (optionally) named tensors with type specified as one of the numpy data types. Params schema is a sequence of ParamSpec, each of which contains name, type, default and shape fields. type field must be specified as one of the MLflow data types, and shape field should be None for scalar parameters, or (-1,) for list parameters. See some examples of constructing them below. Column-based Signature Example Each column-based input and output is represented by a type corresponding to one of MLflow data types and an optional name. Input columns can also be marked as optional, indicating whether they are required as input to the model or can be omitted. The following example displays a modified MLmodel file excerpt containing the model signature for a classification model trained on the Iris dataset. The input has 4 named, numeric columns and 1 named, optional string column.

In addition, the Projects component includes an API and command-line tools for running projects, making it possible to chain together projects into workflows. Table of Contents Overview Specifying Projects Running Projects Iterating Quickly Building Multistep Workflows Overview At the core, MLflow Projects are just a convention for organizing and describing your code to let other data scientists (or automated tools) run it. Each project is simply a directory of files, or a Git repository, containing your code. MLflow can run some projects based on a convention for placing files in this directory (for example, a conda.yaml file is treated as a Conda environment), but you can describe your project in more detail by adding a MLproject file, which is a YAML formatted text file. Each project can specify several properties: NameA human-readable name for the project. Entry PointsCommands that can be run within the project, and information about their parameters. Most projects contain at least one entry point that you want other users to call. Some projects can also contain more than one entry point: for example, you might have a single Git repository containing multiple featurization algorithms. You can also call any .py or .sh file in the project as an entry point. If you list your entry points in a MLproject",0,projects.html

EnvironmentThe software environment that should be used to execute project entry points. This includes all library dependencies required by the project code. See Project Environments for more information about the software environments supported by MLflow Projects, including Conda environments, Virtualenv environments, and Docker containers. You can run any project from a Git URI or from a local directory using the mlflow run command-line tool, or the mlflow.projects.run() Python API. These APIs also allow submitting the project for remote execution on Databricks and Kubernetes. Important By default, MLflow uses a new, temporary working directory for Git projects. This means that you should generally pass any file arguments to MLflow project using absolute, not relative, paths. If your project declares its parameters, MLflow automatically makes paths absolute for parameters of type path.

It allows you to build and use a custom Docker image for running the MLflow project with the desired environment and code.,"such as Java libraries. When you run an MLflow project that specifies a Docker image, MLflow runs your image as is with the parameters specified in your MLproject file. In this case you'll need to pre build your images with both environment and code to run it. To run the project with a new image that's based on your image and contains the project's contents in the /mlflow/projects/code directory, use the --build-image flag when running mlflow run. Environment variables, such as MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI, are propagated inside the Docker container during project execution. Additionally, runs and experiments created by the project are saved to the tracking server specified by your tracking URI. When running against a local tracking URI, MLflow mounts the host system's tracking directory (e.g., a local mlruns directory) inside the container so that metrics, parameters, and artifacts logged during project execution are accessible afterwards. See Dockerized Model Training with MLflow for an example of an MLflow project with a Docker environment. To specify a Docker container environment, you must add an MLproject file to your project.

For example: metrics.""2019-04-02 error rate"" Run Attributes You can search using the following run attributes contained in mlflow.entities.RunInfo: run_id, run_name, status, artifact_uri, user_id, start_time and end_time. The run_id, run_name, status, user_id and artifact_uri attributes have string values, while start_time and end_time are numeric. Other fields in mlflow.entities.RunInfo are not searchable. Run name, Run Name and run name are aliases for run_name. created and Created are aliases for start_time. Note The experiment ID is implicitly selected by the search API. A run's lifecycle_stage attribute is not allowed because it is already encoded as a part of the API's run_view_type field. To search for runs using run_id, it is more efficient to use get_run APIs.

Programmatically Searching Runs The MLflow UI supports searching runs contained within the current experiment. To search runs across multiple experiments, use one of the client APIs. Python Use the MlflowClient.search_runs() or mlflow.search_runs() API to search programmatically. You can specify the list of columns to order by (for example, "metrics.rmse") in the order_by column. The column can contain an optional DESC or ASC value; the default is ASC. The default ordering is to sort by start_time DESC, then run_id. The mlflow.search_runs() API can be used to search for runs within specific experiments which can be identified by experiment IDs or experiment names, but not both at the same time.

How runs and artifacts are recorded As mentioned above, MLflow runs can be recorded to local files, to a SQLAlchemy-compatible database, or remotely to a tracking server. MLflow artifacts can be persisted to local files and a variety of remote file storage solutions. For storing runs and artifacts, MLflow uses two components for storage: backend store and artifact store. While the backend store persists MLflow entities (runs, parameters, metrics, tags, notes, metadata, etc), the artifact store persists artifacts (files, models, images, in-memory objects, or model summary, etc). The MLflow server can be configured with an artifacts HTTP proxy, passing artifact requests through the tracking server to store and retrieve artifacts without having to interact with underlying object store services. Usage of the proxied artifact access feature is described in Scenarios 5 and 6 below. The MLflow client can interface with a variety of backend and artifact storage configurations. Here are four common configuration scenarios: Scenario 1: MLflow on localhost Many developers run MLflow on their local machine, where both the backend and artifact store share a directory on the local filesystem—./mlruns—as shown in the diagram.

With a tracking server running, the MLflow client interacts with the tracking server via REST requests, as shown in the diagram. Command to run the tracking server in this configuration mlflow server --backend-store-uri file:///path/to/mlruns --no-serve-artifacts To store all runs' MLflow entities, the MLflow client interacts with the tracking server via a series of REST requests: Part 1a and b: The MLflow client creates an instance of a RestStore and sends REST API requests to log MLflow entities The Tracking Server creates an instance of a FileStore to save MLflow entities and writes directly to the local mlruns directory For the artifacts, the MLflow client interacts with the tracking server via a REST request: Part 2a, b, and c: The MLflow client uses RestStore to send a REST request to fetch the artifact store URI location The Tracking Server responds with an artifact store URI location The MLflow client creates an instance of a LocalArtifactRepository and saves artifacts to the local filesystem location specified by the artifact store URI (a subdirectory of mlruns) Scenario 4: MLflow with remote Tracking Server, backend and artifact stores MLflow also supports",5,tracking.html

What information does autologging capture when launching short-lived MLflow runs?,"Autologging captures the following information: Framework, Metrics, Parameters, Tags, Artifacts. For example, in the case of fastai, it logs user-specified metrics, optimizer data as parameters, and the parameters of the EarlyStoppingCallback and OneCycleScheduler callbacks. Model checkpoints are logged to a 'models' directory. On training end, the MLflow Model (fastai Learner model) and model summary text are logged. In the case of Pytorch, autologging captures Framework/module, Metrics, Parameters, Tags, and Artifacts. It logs training loss, validation loss, average_test_accuracy, and user-defined metrics. It also logs fit() parameters, optimizer name, learning rate, and epsilon. On training start, it logs the model summary, and on training end, it logs the MLflow Model (Pytorch model) and metrics from the EarlyStoppingCallback.","when launching short-lived MLflow runs that result in datasource information not being logged. Fastai Call mlflow.fastai.autolog() before your training code to enable automatic logging of metrics and parameters. See an example usage with Fastai. Autologging captures the following information: Framework Metrics Parameters Tags Artifacts fastai user-specified metrics Logs optimizer data as parameters. For example, epochs, lr, opt_func, etc; Logs the parameters of the EarlyStoppingCallback and OneCycleScheduler callbacks – Model checkpoints are logged to a 'models' directory; MLflow Model (fastai Learner model) on training end; Model summary text is logged Pytorch Call mlflow.pytorch.autolog() before your Pytorch Lightning training code to enable automatic logging of metrics, parameters, and models. See example usages here. Note that currently, Pytorch autologging supports only models trained using Pytorch Lightning. Autologging is triggered on calls to pytorch_lightning.trainer.Trainer.fit and captures the following information: Framework/module Metrics Parameters Tags Artifacts pytorch_lightning.trainer.Trainer Training loss; validation loss; average_test_accuracy; user-defined-metrics. fit() parameters; optimizer name; learning rate; epsilon. – Model summary on training start, MLflow Model (Pytorch model) on training end; pytorch_lightning.callbacks.earlystopping Training loss; validation loss; average_test_accuracy; user-defined-metrics.

What is the purpose of the --serve-artifacts flag?,"The purpose of the --serve-artifacts flag is to enable proxied access for artifacts. It allows the client to access artifacts via HTTP requests to the MLflow Tracking Server without the need to configure access tokens or username and password environment variables for the underlying object store. By default, a server is launched with this flag to simplify access requirements for users of the MLflow client when writing or retrieving artifacts.","relevant to that experiment. By default, a server is launched with the --serve-artifacts flag to enable proxied access for artifacts. The uri mlflow-artifacts:/ replaces an otherwise explicit object store destination (e.g., "s3:/my_bucket/mlartifacts") for interfacing with artifacts. The client can access artifacts via HTTP requests to the MLflow Tracking Server. This simplifies access requirements for users of the MLflow client, eliminating the need to configure access tokens or username and password environment variables for the underlying object store when writing or retrieving artifacts. To disable proxied access for artifacts, specify --no-serve-artifacts. Provided an MLflow server configuration where the --default-artifact-root is s3://my-root-bucket, the following patterns will all resolve to the configured proxied object store location of s3://my-root-bucket/mlartifacts: https://<host>:<port>/mlartifacts http://<host>/mlartifacts mlflow-artifacts://<host>/mlartifacts mlflow-artifacts://<host>:<port>/mlartifacts mlflow-artifacts:/mlartifacts If the host or host:port declaration is absent in client artifact requests to the MLflow server, the client API will assume that the host is the same as the MLflow Tracking uri. Note If an MLflow server is running with the --artifact-only flag, the client should interact with this server explicitly by including either a host or host:port definition for uri location references for artifacts. Otherwise, all artifact requests will",29,tracking.html
