Flavors are the key concept that makes MLflow Models powerful: they are a convention that deployment tools can use to understand the model, which makes it possible to write tools that work with models from any ML library without having to integrate each tool with each library. MLflow defines several \\u201cstandard\\u201d flavors that all of its built-in deployment tools support, such as a \\u201cPython function\\u201d flavor that describes how to run the model as a Python function. However, libraries can also define and use other flavors.

Table of Contents Overview Specifying Projects Running Projects Iterating Quickly Building Multistep Workflows Overview At the core, MLflow Projects are just a convention for organizing and describing your code to let other data scientists (or automated tools) run it. Each project is simply a directory of files, or a Git repository, containing your code. MLflow can run some projects based on a convention for placing files in this directory (for example, a conda.yaml file is treated as a Conda environment), but you can describe your project in more detail by adding a MLproject file, which is a YAML formatted text file. Each project can specify several properties: NameA human-readable name for the project. Entry PointsCommands that can be run within the project, and information about their parameters. Most projects contain at least one entry point that you want other users to call. Some projects can also contain more than one entry point: for example, you might have a single Git repository containing multiple featurization algorithms. You can also call any .py or .sh file in the project as an entry point.

See Project Environments for more information about the software environments supported by MLflow Projects, including Conda environments, Virtualenv environments, and Docker containers. You can run any project from a Git URI or from a local directory using the mlflow run command-line tool, or the mlflow.projects.run() Python API. These APIs also allow submitting the project for remote execution on Databricks and Kubernetes. Important By default, MLflow uses a new, temporary working directory for Git projects. This means that you should generally pass any file arguments to MLflow project using absolute, not relative, paths. If your project declares its parameters, MLflow automatically makes paths absolute for parameters of type path. Specifying Projects By default, any Git repository or local directory can be treated as an MLflow project; you can invoke any bash or Python script contained in the directory as a project entry point.

Project Environments MLflow currently supports the following project environments: Virtualenv environment, conda environment, Docker container environment, and system environment. Virtualenv environment (preferred)Virtualenv environments support Python packages available on PyPI. When an MLflow Project specifies a Virtualenv environment, MLflow will download the specified version of Python by using pyenv and create an isolated environment that contains the project dependencies using virtualenv, activating it as the execution environment prior to running the project code. You can specify a Virtualenv environment for your MLflow Project by including a python_env entry in your MLproject file. For details, see the Project Directories and Specifying an Environment sections. Docker container environmentDocker containers allow you to capture non-Python dependencies such as Java libraries.

ParametersKey-value input parameters of your choice. Both keys and values are strings. MetricsKey-value metrics, where the value is numeric. Each metric can be updated throughout the course of the run (for example, to track how your model\\u2019s loss function is converging), and MLflow records and lets you visualize the metric\\u2019s full history. ArtifactsOutput files in any format. For example, you can record images (for example, PNGs), models (for example, a pickled scikit-learn model), and data files (for example, a Parquet file) as artifacts. You can record runs using MLflow Python, R, Java, and REST APIs from anywhere you run your code. For example, you can record them in a standalone program, on a remote cloud machine, or in an interactive notebook. If you record runs in an MLflow Project, MLflow remembers the project URI and source version. You can optionally organize runs into experiments, which group together runs for a specific task. You can create an experiment using the mlflow experiments CLI, with mlflow.create_experiment(), or using the corresponding REST\\n    \\n    Please call the submit_function function to submit the generated question and answer.\\n    \"}], \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"functions\": [{\"name\": \"submit_function\", \"description\": \"Call this function to submit the generated question and answer.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"question\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The question asking for the key information in the given paragraph.\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The answer to the question using the information in the given paragraph.\"}}, \"required\": [\"question\", \"answer\"]}}], \"function_call\": \"auto\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"seed\": 2023}": {

Where Runs Are Recorded MLflow runs can be recorded to local files, to a SQLAlchemy-compatible database, or remotely to a tracking server. By default, the MLflow Python API logs runs locally to files in an mlruns directory wherever you ran your program. You can then run mlflow ui to see the logged runs. To log runs remotely, set the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variable to a tracking server\\u2019s URI or call mlflow.set_tracking_uri().
