Adnan Januzaj swapped the lush turf of Old Trafford for the green baize at Sheffield when he
turned up at the snooker World Championships on Wednesday. The Manchester United winger, who has
endured a frustrating season under Louis van Gaal, had turned out for the Under 21 side at Fulham
on Tuesday night amid reports he could be farmed out on loan next season. But Januzaj may want to
consider trying his hand at another sport after displaying his silky skillls on a mini pool table.

Januzaj shows off his potting skills on a mini pool table at the Crucible on Wednesday.
The 20-year-old Belgium international was at the Crucible to cheer on his friend Shaun Murphy in
his quarter-final against Anthony McGill. The 2005 winner moved a step closer to an elusive second
title in Sheffield with a 13-8 victory, sealed with a 67 break. Three centuries in the match, and
the way he accelerated away from 6-6, showed Murphy is a man to fear, and next for him will be
Neil Robertson or Barry Hawkins. Januzaj turned out for Under 21s in the 4-1 victory at Fulham on
Tuesday night.
