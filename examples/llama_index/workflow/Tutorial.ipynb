    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful framework, but the retrieval step can often become a bottleneck, because embedding-based retrieval may not always capture the most relevant context. While many techniques exist to improve retrieval quality, no single solution works universally. Therefore, an effective strategy is to combine multiple retrieval approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept we will explore here is to run several retrieval methods in parallel: (1) standard vector search, (2) keyword-based search (BM25), and (3) web search. The retrieved contexts are then merged, with irrelevant data filtered out to enhance the overall quality.\n",

    "## What is LlamaIndex Workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "[LlamaIndex Workflow](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/workflow/) is an event-driven orchestration framework for designing dynamic AI applications. The core of LlamaIndex Workflow consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Steps` are units of execution, representing distinct actions in the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Events` trigger these steps, acting as signals that control the workflow's flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Workflow` connects these two as a Python class. Each step is implemented as a method of the workflow class, defined with input and output events.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple yet powerful abstraction allows you to break down complex tasks into manageable steps, enabling greater flexibility and scalability. As a nature of event-driven design, it is super easy to design parallel/asynchronous execution flow, which significantly enhances efficiency involve long-running tasks and provides production-ready scalability.\n"

    "For the LlamaIndex Workflow, we use the new [Model-from-code](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#models-from-code) method, which logs models as standalone Python scripts. This approach avoids the risks and instability associated with serialization methods like pickle, relying instead on code as the single source of truth for the model definition. When combined with MLflow's environment-freezing capability, it provides a reliable way to persist models. For more details, refer to the [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#models-from-code).\n",

    "[MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) is a new feature that brings observability to LLM applications. It integrates seamlessly with LlamaIndex, recording all inputs, outputs, and metadata about intermediate steps during workflow execution. Since we called `mlflow.llama_index.autolog()` at the start, every LlamaIndex operation has been traced and recorded in the MLflow Experiment.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored how the combination of LlamaIndex and MLflow can elevate the development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows, bringing together powerful model management and observability capabilities. By integrating multiple retrieval strategies—such as vector search, BM25, and web search—we demonstrated how flexible retrieval can enhance the performance of LLM-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment Tracking** allowed us to organize and log different workflow configurations, ensuring reproducibility and enabling us to track model performance across multiple runs.\n",
    "- **MLflow Evaluate** enabled us to easily log and evaluate the workflow with different retriever strategies, using key metrics like latency and answer correctness to compare performance.\n",
    "- **MLflow UI** gave us a clear visualization of how various retrieval strategies impacted both accuracy and latency, helping us identify the most effective configurations.\n",
    "- **MLflow Tracing**, integrated with LlamaIndex, provided detailed observability into each step of the workflow for diagnosing quality issues, such as incorrect reranking of search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tools, you have a complete framework for building, logging, and optimizing RAG workflows. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the ability to track, evaluate, and fine-tune every aspect of model performance will be essential. We highly encourage you to experiment further and see how these tools can be tailored to your own applications.\n",
