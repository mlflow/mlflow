Do not use the `Squash and merge` option, as it makes reverting individual commits impossible. If the `Rebase and merge` option is disabled (it usually is), follow [Configuring commit rebasing for pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-rebasing-for-pull-requests) to temporarily enable it, and disable it once the PR is merged.'
