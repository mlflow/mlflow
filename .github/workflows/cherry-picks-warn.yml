          **If you are cherry-picking commits to a release branch, "Rebase and merge" must be used when merging this PR, NOT "Squash and merge".**

          ### Why "Squash and merge" causes problems:

          - It makes reverting individual commits impossible
          - It removes the association between original and cherry-picked commits
          - It makes it difficult to track which commits have been cherry-picked
          - It causes incorrect results in:
            - [`update-release-labels.yml`](.github/workflows/update-release-labels.yml)
            - [`update_changelog.py`](dev/update_changelog.py)
            - [`check_patch_prs.py`](dev/check_patch_prs.py)

          If "Rebase and merge" is disabled, follow [Configuring commit rebasing for pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-rebasing-for-pull-requests) to enable it.'
