      description: |
        For bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:
        ```python
        # MLflow < 2.0
        print("MLflow version:", mlflow.__version__)
        print("Tracking URI:", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())
        print("Artifact URI:", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())

        # MLflow >= 2.0
        mlflow.doctor()
        ```
        Then, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below. If you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it.

        Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

        ### Bad

        Requires modifications (e.g., adding missing import statements) to run.

        ```python
        with mlflow.start_run():  # `mlflow` is not imported
            mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")  # `model` is undefined
        ```

        ### Good

        Does not require any modifications to run.

        ```python
        from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
        from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
        import mlflow

        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
        model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)
        with mlflow.start_run():
            mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
        ```
