    Logs an expectation (ground truth) to a Trace.


    Args:
        trace_id: The ID of the trace.
        name: The name of the expectation assessment e.g., "expected_answer
        source: The source of the expectation assessment. Must be either an instance of
                :py:class:`~mlflow.entities.AssessmentSource` or a string that
                is a valid value in the
                :py:class:`~mlflow.entities.AssessmentSourceType` enum.
        value: The value of the expectation. It can be any JSON-serializable value.
        metadata: Additional metadata for the expectation.
        span_id: The ID of the span associated with the expectation, if it needs be
                associated with a specific span in the trace.

    Returns:
        :py:class:`~mlflow.entities.Assessment`: The created expectation assessment.

    Example:

    The following code annotates a trace with human-provided ground truth.

    .. code-block:: python

        import mlflow
        from mlflow.entities.assessment import AssessmentSourceType

    Logs a feedback to a Trace.

    Args:
        trace_id: The ID of the trace.
        name: The name of the feedback assessment e.g., "faithfulness"
        source: The source of the expectation assessment. Must be either an instance of

        value: The value of the expectation. It can be any JSON-serializable value.
        error: An error object representing any issues encountered while computing the
            feedback, e.g., a timeout error from an LLM judge. Either this or `value`
            must be provided.

    Example:

    The following code annotates a trace with a feedback provided by LLM-as-a-Judge.

    .. code-block:: python

        source = AssessmentSource(

            rationale="The model is faithful to the input.",
            metadata={"model": "gpt-4o-mini"},
        )

    You can also log an error information during the feedback generation process. To do so,
    provide an instance of :py:class:`~mlflow.entities.AssessmentError` to the `error`
    parameter, and leave the `value` parameter as `None`.
