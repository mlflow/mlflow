    Provides instrumentation hooks for important autologging lifecycle events, including:

        - Calls to `mlflow.autolog()` APIs
        - Calls to patched APIs with associated termination states

        - Calls to original / underlying APIs made by patched function code with
          associated termination states ("success" and "failure due to error")

    Default implementations are included for each of these hooks, which emit corresponding
    DEBUG-level logging statements. Developers can provide their own hook implementations
    by subclassing `AutologgingEventLogger` and calling the static
    `AutologgingEventLogger.set_logger()` method to supply a new event logger instance.

    Callers fetch the configured logger via `AutologgingEventLogger.get_logger()`
    and invoke one or more hooks (e.g., `AutologgingEventLogger.get_logger().log_autolog_called()`).
