    """
    Delete a registered scorer from the MLflow experiment.

    This function permanently removes scorer registrations.
    The behavior of this function varies depending on the backend store and version parameter:

    **OSS MLflow Tracking Backend:**
        - Supports versioning with granular deletion options
        - Can delete specific versions or all versions of a scorer by setting `version`
          parameter to "all"

    **Databricks Backend:**
        - Does not support versioning
        - Deletes the entire scorer regardless of version parameter
        - `version` parameter must be None

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the scorer to delete. This must match exactly with the
            name used during scorer registration.
        experiment_id (str, optional): The ID of the MLflow experiment containing the scorer.
            If None, uses the currently active experiment as determined by
            :func:`mlflow.get_experiment_by_name` or :func:`mlflow.set_experiment`.
        version (int | str | None, optional): The version(s) to delete:
            For OSS MLflow tracking backend: if `None`, deletes the latest version only, if version
            is an integer, deletes the specific version, if version is the string 'all', deletes
            all versions of the scorer
            For Databricks backend, the version must be set to `None` (versioning not supported)

    Raises:
        mlflow.MlflowException: If the scorer with the specified name is not found in
            the experiment, if the specified version doesn't exist, or if versioning
            is not supported for the current backend.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from mlflow.genai.scorers import delete_scorer

            # Delete the latest version of a scorer from current experiment
            delete_scorer(name="accuracy_scorer")

            # Delete a specific version of a scorer
            delete_scorer(name="safety_scorer", version=2)

            # Delete all versions of a scorer
            delete_scorer(name="relevance_scorer", version="all")

            # Delete a scorer from a specific experiment
            delete_scorer(name="harmfulness_scorer", experiment_id="123", version=1)
    """

    store = _get_scorer_store()
    return store.delete_scorer(experiment_id, name, version)
