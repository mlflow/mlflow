        Args:
            inputs (optional): A single input to the target model/app.
            outputs (optional): A single output from the target model/app.
            expectations (optional): Ground truth, or a dictionary of ground
                truths for individual output fields.
            trace (optional): Json representation of a trace object corresponding to
                the prediction for the row. Required when any of scorers requires a
                trace in order to compute assessments/scores.
            **kwargs (optional): Additional keyword arguments passed to the scorer. The scorer
                can take additional keyword arguments that are a part of the input eval dataset.
                NB: Currently, the evaluation harness only passes the following reserved
                    extra keyword arguments. This will be fully flexible once we migrate off
                    the agent eval harness.

                    - retrieved_context (optional): Retrieved context, can be from your
                        input eval dataset or from trace
                    - custom_expected (optional): Custom expected results from input eval dataset
                    - custom_inputs (optional): Custom inputs from your input eval dataset
                    - custom_outputs (optional): Custom outputs from the agent's response
                    - tool_calls (optional): Tool calls from the agent's response.
