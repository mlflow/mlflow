# NB: We use lazy imports for builtin_scorers to avoid a circular dependency issue.
#
# The circular dependency chain:
# 1. scorers/__init__.py imports from builtin_scorers (if done eagerly)
# 2. builtin_scorers.py has `class BuiltInScorer(Judge)` which imports Judge from judges.base
# 3. judges.base.py has `class Judge(Scorer)` which imports Scorer from scorers.base
# 4. When importing scorers.base, Python first initializes the scorers package (__init__.py)
# 5. This would try to import builtin_scorers, creating a circular import
#
# Solution:
# - We use Python's __getattr__ mechanism to defer the import of builtin_scorers until
#   the specific scorer classes are actually accessed at runtime
# - The TYPE_CHECKING block provides type hints for IDEs and static analysis tools
#   without actually importing the modules at runtime (TYPE_CHECKING is only True
#   during static analysis, never during actual execution)
# - This allows Sphinx autodoc and IDEs to understand the module structure while
#   avoiding the circular import at runtime
