    Create a custom MLflow judge instance.

    Args:
        name: The name of the judge
        instructions: Natural language instructions for evaluation. Must contain at least one
                      template variable: {{ inputs }}, {{ outputs }}, {{ expectations }},
                      or {{ trace }} to reference evaluation data. Custom variables are not
                      supported.
        model: The model identifier to use for evaluation (e.g., "openai:/gpt-4")

    Returns:
        An InstructionsJudge instance configured with the provided parameters
