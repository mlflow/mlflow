OpenTelemetry REST API endpoints for MLflow FastAPI server.

This module implements the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) REST API for ingesting spans
according to the OTel specification:
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp

Note: This is a minimal implementation that serves as a placeholder for the OTel endpoint.
The actual span ingestion logic would need to properly convert incoming OTel format spans
to MLflow spans, which requires more complex conversion logic.
