// This file should ONLY be used for preserving Ant Design resets that
// we need to persist. We filter them out using PostCSS in both Webpack (for dev)
// and rollup (for distribution). If they need to be reintroduced, they should be
// wrapped by the ant prefix so that they do not pollute the global styles
// (for inputs, headers, etc).

// The original set of resets can be found here:
// https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/core/global.less
