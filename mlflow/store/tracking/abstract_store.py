                defined in :py:class:`mlflow.entities.ViewType`.
            max_results: Maximum number of experiments desired. Certain server backend may apply

            filter_string: Filter query string (e.g., ``"name = 'my_experiment'"``), defaults to
                searching for all experiments. The following identifiers, comparators, and logical
                operators are supported.

                Identifiers
                  - ``name``: Experiment name
                  - ``creation_time``: Experiment creation time

                    spaces, it must be wrapped with backticks (e.g., ``"tags.`extra key`"``).

                Comparators for string attributes and tags
                  - ``=``: Equal to
                  - ``!=``: Not equal to
                  - ``LIKE``: Case-sensitive pattern match
                  - ``ILIKE``: Case-insensitive pattern match

                  - ``!=``: Not equal to
                  - ``<``: Less than
                  - ``<=``: Less than or equal to
                  - ``>``: Greater than

                Logical operators
                  - ``AND``: Combines two sub-queries and returns True if both of them are True.

            order_by: List of columns to order by. The ``order_by`` column can contain an optional
                ``DESC`` or ``ASC`` value (e.g., ``"name DESC"``). The default ordering is ``ASC``,
                so ``"name"`` is equivalent to ``"name ASC"``. If unspecified, defaults to
                ``["last_update_time DESC"]``, which lists experiments updated most recently first.
                The following fields are supported:

                - ``experiment_id``: Experiment ID
                - ``name``: Experiment name
                - ``creation_time``: Experiment creation time
                - ``last_update_time``: Experiment last update time

            page_token: Token specifying the next page of results. It should be obtained from
                a ``search_experiments`` call.

        Returns:
