📣 This is the `mlflow-skinny` package, a lightweight MLflow package without SQL storage, server, UI, or data science dependencies.
Additional dependencies can be installed to leverage the full feature set of MLflow. For example:

- To use the `mlflow.sklearn` component of MLflow Models, install `scikit-learn`, `numpy` and `pandas`.
- To use SQL-based metadata storage, install `sqlalchemy`, `alembic`, and `sqlparse`.
- To use serving-based features, install `flask` and `pandas`.

</div>

You can run MLflow in many different environments, including local machines, on-premise servers, and cloud infrastructure.

Trusted by thousands of organizations, MLflow is now offered as a managed service by most major cloud providers:

- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/experiments/)
- [Azure ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow?view=azureml-api-2)
- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/managed-mlflow)
- [Nebius](https://nebius.com/services/managed-mlflow)

For hosting MLflow on your own infrastructure, please refer to [this guidance](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/#tracking-setup).

## 🗣️ Supported Programming Languages

- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/)
- [TypeScript / JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mlflow-tracing)
- [Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mlflow/mlflow-client)
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlflow/readme/README.html)

## 🔗 Integrations

MLflow is natively integrated with many popular machine learning frameworks and GenAI libraries.

![Integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/refs/heads/master/assets/readme-integrations.png)

## Usage Examples

### Experiment Tracking ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/))

The following examples trains a simple regression model with scikit-learn, while enabling MLflow's [autologging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html) feature for experiment tracking.

```python
import mlflow

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Enable MLflow's automatic experiment tracking for scikit-learn
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

# Load the training dataset
db = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)

rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)
# MLflow triggers logging automatically upon model fitting
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Once the above code finishes, run the following command in a separate terminal and access the MLflow UI via the printed URL. An MLflow **Run** should be automatically created, which tracks the training dataset, hyper parameters, performance metrics, the trained model, dependencies, and even more.

```
mlflow ui
```

### Evaluating Models ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-evaluation/index.html))

The following example runs automatic evaluation for question-answering tasks with several built-in metrics.

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Evaluation set contains (1) input question (2) model outputs (3) ground truth
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Spark?"],
        "outputs": [
            "MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.",
            "Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.",
        ],
        "ground_truth": [
            "MLflow is an open-source platform for productionizing AI.",
            "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system.",
        ],
    }
)
eval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
    df, predictions="outputs", targets="ground_truth"
)

# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation results to
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="evaluate_qa"):
    # Run automatic evaluation with a set of built-in metrics for question-answering models
    results = mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_dataset,
        model_type="question-answering",
    )

print(results.tables["eval_results_table"])
```

### Observability ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html))

MLflow Tracing provides LLM observability for various GenAI libraries such as OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, AutoGen, and more. To enable auto-tracing, call `mlflow.xyz.autolog()` before running your models. Refer to the documentation for customization and manual instrumentation.

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

# Enable tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Query OpenAI LLM normally
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}],
    temperature=0.1,
)
```

Then navigate to the "Traces" tab in the MLflow UI to find the trace records OpenAI query.
