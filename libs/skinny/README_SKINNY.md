ðŸ“£ This is the `mlflow-skinny` package, a lightweight MLflow package without SQL storage, server, UI, or data science dependencies.
Additional dependencies can be installed to leverage the full feature set of MLflow. For example:

- To use the `mlflow.sklearn` component of MLflow Models, install `scikit-learn`, `numpy` and `pandas`.
- To use SQL-based metadata storage, install `sqlalchemy`, `alembic`, and `sqlparse`.
- To use serving-based features, install `flask` and `pandas`.

# Conftest

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/open-policy-agent/opa)](https://goreportcard.com/report/open-policy-agent/conftest) [![Netlify](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2d928746-3380-4123-b0eb-1fd74ba390db/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vibrant-villani-65041c/deploys)

Conftest helps you write tests against structured configuration data. Using Conftest you can
write tests for your Kubernetes configuration, Tekton pipeline definitions, Terraform code,
Serverless configs or any other config files.

Conftest uses the Rego language from [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) for writing
the assertions. You can read more about Rego in [How do I write policies](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/how-do-i-write-policies.html)
in the Open Policy Agent documentation.

Here's a quick example. Save the following as `policy/deployment.rego`:

```rego
package main

deny contains msg if {
  input.kind == "Deployment"
  not input.spec.template.spec.securityContext.runAsNonRoot

  msg := "Containers must not run as root"
}

deny contains msg if {
  input.kind == "Deployment"
  not input.spec.selector.matchLabels.app

  msg := "Containers must provide app label for pod selectors"
}
```

Assuming you have a Kubernetes deployment in `deployment.yaml` you can run Conftest like so:

```console
$ conftest test deployment.yaml
FAIL - deployment.yaml - Containers must not run as root
FAIL - deployment.yaml - Containers must provide app label for pod selectors

2 tests, 0 passed, 0 warnings, 2 failures, 0 exceptions
```

Conftest isn't specific to Kubernetes. It will happily let you write tests for any configuration files in a variety of different formats. See the [documentation](https://www.conftest.dev/) for [installation instructions](https://www.conftest.dev/install/) and
more details about the features.
