MLflow Typescript SDK is a variant of the [MLflow Python SDK](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) that provides a TypeScript API for MLflow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MLflow Typescript SDK is catching up with the Python SDK. Currently only support [Tracing]() and [Feedback Collection]() features. Please raise an issue in Github if you need a feature that is not supported.

## Installation

```bash
npm install mlflow-tracing
```

> [!NOTE]
> MLflow Typescript SDK requires Node.js 20 or higher.

## Quickstart

Start MLflow Tracking Server if you don't have one already:

```bash
pip install mlflow
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlruns.db --port 5000
```

Self-hosting MLflow server requires Python 3.10 or higher. If you don't have one, you can also use [managed MLflow service](https://mlflow.org/#get-started) for free to get started quickly.

Instantiate MLflow SDK in your application:

```typescript
import * as mlflow from 'mlflow-tracing';

mlflow.init({
  trackingUri: 'http://localhost:5000',
  experimentId: '<experiment-id>'
});
```

Create a trace:

```typescript
// Wrap a function with mlflow.trace to generate a span when the function is called.
// MLflow will automatically record the function name, arguments, return value,
// latency, and exception information to the span.
const getWeather = mlflow.trace(
  (city: string) => {
    return `The weather in ${city} is sunny`;
  },
  // Pass options to set span name. See https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/typescript-sdk
  // for the full list of options.
  { name: 'get-weather' }
);
getWeather('San Francisco');

// Alternatively, start and end span manually
const span = mlflow.startSpan({ name: 'my-span' });
span.end();
```

#### Track Annotation and User Feedback Attached to Traces

Collecting and managing feedback is essential for improving your application. MLflow Tracing allows you to attach user feedback and annotations directly to traces, creating a rich dataset for analysis.

This feedback data helps you understand user satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and build better evaluation datasets based on real user interactions.

#### Systematic Quality Assessment Throughout Your Application

Evaluating the performance of your application is crucial, but creating a reliable evaluation process can be challenging. Traces serve as a rich data source, helping you assess quality with precise metrics for all components.

When combined with MLflow's evaluation capabilities, you get a seamless experience for assessing and improving your application's performance.
