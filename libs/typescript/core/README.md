## Installation

```bash
npm install mlflow-tracing
```

## Quickstart

Start MLflow Tracking Server. If you have a local Python environment, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install mlflow
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlruns.db --port 5000
```

If you don't have Python environment locally, MLflow also supports Docker deployment or managed services. See [Self-Hosting Guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/self-hosting/index.html) for getting started.

Instantiate MLflow SDK in your application:

```typescript
import * as mlflow from 'mlflow-tracing';

mlflow.init({
  trackingUri: 'http://localhost:5000',
  experimentId: '<experiment-id>'
});
```

Create a trace:

```typescript
// Wrap a function with mlflow.trace to generate a span when the function is called.
// MLflow will automatically record the function name, arguments, return value,
// latency, and exception information to the span.
const getWeather = mlflow.trace(
  (city: string) => {
    return `The weather in ${city} is sunny`;
  },
  // Pass options to set span name. See https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/typescript-sdk
  // for the full list of options.
  { name: 'get-weather' }
);
getWeather('San Francisco');

// Alternatively, start and end span manually
const span = mlflow.startSpan({ name: 'my-span' });
span.end();
```
